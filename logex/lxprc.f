C     DATE     WHO  DESCRIPTION 
C     810204   KNM  SUBROUTINE WRITTEN
C 
C     810803   KNM  TYPE COMMAND WAS ADDED. 
C 
C     810810   KNM  THE <COMMAND>=? WAS CHANGED TO <COMMAND>
C 
C     820329   KNM  SUBROUTINE ARGUMENTS WERE CHANGED & LXCOM WAS 
C                   INCLUDED. THE CALL TO LXOPN WAS ADDED TO THE LOG
C                   COMMAND.
C 
C     820416   KNM  THE OUTPUT COMMAND REPLACED THE LU COMMAND.  THE
C                   USER MAY SPECIFY ANY LOGICAL UNIT OR AN OUTPUT
C                   FILE IN THE FORM <NAME>:<SECU.CODE>:<CARTRIDGE> 
C 
C     820525   CAK  FIXED UP TO ALLOW SCALE VALUES TO BE EQUAL
C                   (CAUSES PLOT TO SELF-SCALE). BUG IN FORMAT
C                   9520 REMOVED TO ELIMINATE FMT ERR 3 
C 
C     820607   CAK  LXPRC HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM A SUBROUTINE TO A 
C                   SEGMENT PROGRAM OF LOGEX. CALLING ARGUMENTS WERE
C                   PLACED INTO COMMON. 
C 
C     820625   KNM  THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT PARAMETERS WERE ADDED TO THE 
C                   OUTPUT COMMAND. THE WIDTH OF THE OUTPUT IS IN UNITS 
C                   OF CHARACTERS. THE HEIGHT PARAMETER IS THE LENGTH 
C                   OF THE OUTPUT DISPLAY IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF LINES.
C 
C     820816   KNM  EIGHT IF STATEMENTS TESTING THE VALUE OF IKEY WERE
C                   ELIMINATED & REPLACED WITH A COMPUTED GO TO STATE-
C                   MENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS ROUTINE. CALCULATING
C                   THE SCALE VALUE IN THE SCALE COMMAND WAS DELETED
C                   AND PLACED IN LXTPL.
C 
C     820825   KNM  SUBROUTINE LXLSN NOW HANDLES LOG & SKED COMMANDS
C                   WHICH SPECIFY A 2-CHAR NAME OR A FULL NAMR. 
C 
C     820909   KNM  CFILE COMMAND WAS ADDED.
C 
C     820922   KNM  WIDTH & HEIGHT PARAMETERS WERE TAKEN OUT OF THE 
C                   OUTPUT COMMAND. THE SIZE COMMAND PERFORMS THIS
C                   FUNCTION NOW. 
C 
C     850130   MWH  ALLOW OUTPUT THRU HPIB (DRIVER TYPE o'37')
C 
C     850512   WEH  FIX DEFAULT CARTRIDGE SO IT WORKS AS ADVERTISED 
C                   IN LOG COMMAND
C
C     871130   LEF  Changed back to subroutine for use with CDS.

C      CALLING SUBROUTINES: 
C 
C      File manager package routines
C      Character manipulation routines
C      GTPRM - parses the input buffer and returns the next parameter.
C      LXOPN - Open log file
C 
C  LOCAL VARIABLES: 
C 
      character*79 outbuf
      integer nchar, ichmv
      dimension iparm(1)
C 
      equivalence (parm,iparm(1))
C 
C     ICH - character counter
C     IPRM - The special character is stored in IPRM upon its return
C            from GTPRM.
C     ITLU - Variable that determines whether the output LU is a non-
C            disc devices such as a line printer or terminal.
