      SUBROUTINE MA2TP(IBUF,ILOW,LFT,IFAS,ICAP,ISTP,ITAC, 
     .            IRDY),CONVERT MAT BUFFER TO TP DATA C#890516:19:04# 
C 
C     This routine converts the buffers returned from the MAT 
C     into the tape drive status information. 
C 
C  INPUT: 
C 
      DIMENSION IBUF(1) 
C      - buffers of length 5 words, as returned from MATCN
C 
C  OUTPUT:
C 
C     ILOW - low tape sensor
C     LFT - footage counter 
C     IFAS - fast speed button
C     ICAP - capstan status 
C     ISTP - stop command 
C     ITAC - tach lock
C     IRDY - ready status 
C

C        TPbdrsvvvv 
C     where each letter is a character with the following bits
C                   b = bits for low tape, fast speed, capstan, 
C                        and stop command 
C                   d = bits for tape lock, tach lock, and front panel (2)
C                   r = bits for ready, reset footage, and value type (2) 
C                   s = bits for decimal point 1, decimal point 2,
C                       sign, and MSB of value
C                   vvvv = four digits of value, hex. 
C     Note we are only concerned with the last 8 characters
