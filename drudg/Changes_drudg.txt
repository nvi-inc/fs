All changes in drudg from 2005Oct26 onwards.
2006Jun29  Modified disk2file_abort command so that
           (qoutine email from WEH:)
           The command form for disk2file=abort has changed slightly. It should be:
               disk2file=abort,autoftp,string
           Where is "autoftp" is a literal "autoftp" that indicates that the file
           should be ftp'd. If it is missing, there is no ftp-ing. If "autoftp" is
           present, "string" can be arbitrary string that is passed to the
           "autoftp" script, maybe it would be called the "autoftp string". The
           skedf.ctl should have a user specifed default (on of off for "autoftp")
           andbe able to specify a string. Maybe something like:
                 autoftp on/off string
           The "string" of course can be missing, i.e. blank. In the data_transfer
           override menu then you could either change the state of the on/off and a
           different string.

           This involved changes to rdctl.f, xfer_override.f,
           snap_disk2file_abort.f  and  ../skdrincl/data_xfer.ftni.


2006Jun27  snap.f.  For Mark5 & continuous (for use in RDVs),
           we were supposed to change to early start=25 and
           adaptive.  This wasn't being handled correctly.

2006Jun16  procs.f Fixed bug introduced in 2004Sep13 in track
           assignment for K4. Need to subtract 3.

2006Jun13  snap.f   Modified scan_name to include station code.
           snap_disk2file_abort.f  Removed ldisk2file stuff
           from arg list, and referenced via common.
           xfer_override.f.  Added in option to change default
           script.
           drcom.ftni.  Removed disk2file stuff and put in
           ../skdrincl.ftni
           snap.f Changed Default disk2file destination to be
           session_station_scanname.m5a

2006May30  procs.f.  In setup procedure moved BBC and IFD command
           after form= command.
2006May02  BUGFIX. procs.f Handle case when LO1 is not defined, but LO3 is.

2005Nov29  BUGFIX. procs.f. Three places where was checking
           cmode(istn,icode). Check was done against lower case
           values. Should be upper. This only affected Mark3
           modes.
2005Nov29  BUGFIX. setup_name.f was using unitialized variable
           istat in calling itras. Should have been using istn.

2005Nov29  skdrut/itras was modified to use Mark4 Track assignments.
           This required modifications to proc.f and trkall.f.

2005Oct26  snap.f.  Fixed bug in writing out scan names.
