Drudg release notes 9.10.2
Date of release is 2008-Feb-01

1. Some versions of linux don't initialize Fortran "Block Data"
commands correctly.  This caused an error when processing the
"equipment" line of skedf.ctl.  Fixed by expliciting initializing
all of the recorder and rack types.

2. Drudg would emit an incorrect "checkmk5" after scans which
were not recorded. Fixed so that drudg checks to see if data
was recorded.
