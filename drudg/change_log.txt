This file contains a summary of changes made and why.
2020May29 snap.f. Fixed bug where if a station had early start then there would be no PREOB. 
2020Feb20 proc_dbbc_bbc.f, proc_lba_ifp.f, proc_mracks_vc.f proc_vracks_bbc.f,proc_vc_cmd.f. Added implicit none.
          Also added luscn to routines invalid_if
2019Nov20 Several changes to replace f90 code by f77 code(by Ed Himwich):
          skdrini.f, snap.f, ../skdrut/vmoinp.f, vobinp.f, frinp.f, iwhere_in_string_list_nocase.f
2019Nov20 Bug fixes in snap.f and in sdrini.f.  Indices of arrays used wrong variables, eg. foo(ic) should be foo(i)
2019Sep23 proc_disk_tracks.f: If recorder=none do not round up channels recorded to power of 2. 
2019Aug15-Sep23.  Many changes merging VGOS and S/X branch together. Some bug fixes. About 20 files changed. 
2018Nov13 proc_disk_tracks.f: Removed checking of BW/samplerate. This will now be handled by the FS. 
2018Sep25 Makefile, drudg_rdctl.f: Location of skedf.ctl varies depending on whether computer is PC-FS or not. 
2018Sep11
   proc_disk_tracks.f: Comments modified based on email from WEH 2018Sep06. Also if fila10g, use 64 bit mask for Mark5C.  
   proc_dbbc_pfb_tracks.f: Fixed an error in writing out a mask. 
   proc_track_mask_lines.f: New routine.  writes out the mask lines for the proc_disk_tracks.f and proc_dbbc_pfb_tracks.f
2018Sep05 
   New routine: drudg_write_comment.f.  This outputs comment lines in files. 
   proc_mk5_init1.f:  Got rid of extraneous '"'  (double quotes) at end of comment lines.           
   proc_disk_tracks.f: Better debug info. Now if it doesn't find a valid mode, will write 
   all the "CSB" info (Channel-Sideband-Bit) info that was in the sked file. 
2018Sep04 
   get_version.f Removed line that wrote debug info. This was printing spurious "32". 
2018Aug18 
   Added support for modes that vsi2
   check_csb_list.f:    Increased mask from 32 bits to 64 bits
   proc_disk_tracks.f:  Added wastro2 and geo2 modes which can use 64 tracks. Also output comments 
   if DBBC_DDC or  DBBC_DDC/FILA10G saying how things should be setup for recorder. 
2018Jul20 
  New subroutine write_drudge_release_line for use by procintr.f and snapintf.f. Removed this functionality from both.
  Put all version information in common file  drver_com.ftni. Added this include file to fdrudg.f.
  Introduced  new char*32  string crel_FS which contains release info. 
  Modified get_version to get crel_fs (which is specified at compile time).  
  New function crelease.c gets RELEASE string at compile time. 
  fdrudg.f and write_drudge_release_line.f will include crel_fs if it is non-blank.  
  Makefile was modified to correctly get the RELEASE      
2018Jun19 
  proc_setup.f: Fixed bug in cont_cal. If Rack is DBBC_DDC and 'cont_cal off' emit cont_cal=off;
2018Jun17 
  sread.f: When reading in a VEX file printed an extra blank line when it was done reading in the schedule. 
  his showed up as a blank line between "$SOURCES" and "Experiment name: ",
  drudg_rdctl.f:  Removed erroneous report of error in label command.
  Also made sure there were spaces between all sections when it was writing out progrees of reading skedf.ctl. 
  fdrudg.f: Removed debugging statement that wrote out first recorder
2018Jun05 vobinp.f: Modified so if a station in the scan is not in the station list, then program 
          aborts with warning message.
2018Jun05 ivgtst.f: Version in drudg had bug where if station were missing in station list, set the value 
          to # of stations. This had been fixed in 2014 in sked, but not propagated here. Now it is.           
2018May02 snap.f: Fine tuning staggered start. If the station offset for OUR station is zero, assume non-staggered.
2018May02 snap.f: Take account of staggered start in calculating recording 
2018Apr02 snap.f: Fixed staggered start. I hope. 
2017Dec23 snap.f:  If staggered start (different stations start at different times) then change handling of 
          calibrations.  A.) Uses nomimal data_valid_time to start recording data and do calibration. 
          B.) ical_time later sets data valid flag.  
          ical_time is either nominal cal_time (10 sec) or ical_time_staggered, or if cont_cal is on, then 1.
2017Dec20 proc_dbbc_pfb_tracks.f, proc_disk_tracks.f.  Got rid of extra "," before mask in 'bit_streams=' command. 
2017Dec20 proc_mk5_init2.f.  Changed 'bank_set?' to 'mk5=bank_set?'
2017Oct24 proc_dbbc_pfb_tracks.f, proc_disk_tracks.f 
          If 'bit_streams' then only care about mask. Everything else is null.
20178ct24 proc_mk5_int2.f:  Added 'bank_set?'  after bank_check
2017Oct24 MAX_SOR-->5000, MAX_CEL-->4990
2017Oct24 vlbah.f  Fixed output bugs in writing vlba pointing file. 
2017Oct24 wrsos.f  Fixed bug in vlba pointing file. if RA seconds is >59.65s, then used to write out as 60.0s.

2016Nov21 ../skdrut/stinp.f  Set default RACK, RECORDER types before checking for error condition. Previously if there was an error these would not be set.
2016Nov21 proc_dbbc_bbc.f. Don't check what the ORIGINAL (in schedule) rack type was. Should not matter
2016Sep11 proc_setup.f.  Made input for cont_cal, cont_cal_parity appear on same line as prompt.

2016Jul28
1. drudg_rdctl.f  Added 'cfirstrec_def' to capture default recorder if 'equipment override' is on in skedf.ctl
2. fdrudg.f       Use 'cfirstrec_def' if 'equipment override' is on in skedf.ctl.
3. ../skdrut/stinp.f   Initialize cfirstrec="1 " even if you  have an error in reading in terminal line. Changed dimension of crack to char*20
4. ../skdrut/unpvt.f   Changed dimension ofrack_type to char*20.

2016Apr07.
1. Fixed typographic bug in proc_disk_tracks with filag10 mode. 

2016Jan19 Lots of changes having to do with supporting DBBC_PFB. Here is a quick summary.
1. ../skdrincl/skparm.ftni: Max_bbc=16-->32
2. proc_setup.f:  Different handling of DBBC_DDC and DBBC_PFB. Modifed to not emit BBC commands if DBBC_PFB.

3. proc_dbbc_pfb_tracks.f: New routine to handle various track stuff for DBBC_PFB
4. proc_ifd.f:  Fixed so that emit commands for all IFs. The issue is that DBBCs can re-use the same BBC number.
5. proc_mracks_vc.f:  Changed initialization of some variables since max_bbc-->32.
6. proc_vc_name.f.  Only write out command if cname_vc<> " ". (if DBBC_PFB/* then cname_vc=" ")

8. ../skdrincl/valid_hardware.ftni.  Increased number of valid racks. 
9. ../skdrut/valid_hardware_blk.f.   DBBC-->DBBC_DDC, added DBBC_PFB, DBBC_PFB/fila10g
10. ../skdrut/vmoinp.f, vunptrk.f  max_tracks-->2*max_tracks. This is because sign, magnitude can now be on same track (but drudg expects to be on different tracks.
11. ../skdrut/indexx_int2.f.   New routine. Sort an integer*2 array.
12. ../skdrut/indexx_string.f  New routine. Sort an array of strings. Used by proc_dbbc_pfb_tracks.f

          fdrudg.f        If rack or recorder is "UNKNOWN" set to "none".  Onyly use equipment from skedf.ctl if explicitly called. 
2015Jun30 unpvt.f, stinp.f    Had to increase space for rack, recorder since size went char*8-->char*12
2015Jun19 proc_disk_tracks.f  Reorganized after adding CDAS and VLBAC rack types.  
          Checking tracks in (proc_disk_tracks) moved to subroutine check_csb_list.f

../skdrut/gnpas.f

2014Jun02 proc_mracks_vc.f
This routine is called: call proc_mracks_vc(icode,ic,ib,ichan)
ic=channel #
ib=BBC #

The main idea is that this routine cycles through all channels one at a time and write lines like:
vc11=245.99,8.00,u
or
vc01=210.00,8.0,ul


To determine whether to write out "u", "l", or "ul" it checks to see if there are any channels that have the same channel # and bbc # that it was called with.  The code fragment that did the checking was:
        DO ichanx=ic,nchan(istn,icode) !remaining channels
           icx=invcx(ichanx,istn,icode) ! channel number
           if (ib.eq.ibbcx(icx,istn,icode)) then ! Same BBC?               
             if(itras(1,1,1,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99 .or. 
     >          itras(1,1,2,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99) ku=.true. 
             if(itras(2,1,1,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99 .or.
     >          itras(2,1,2,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99) kl=.true.                  
           endif
        enddo

This normally works because usually ic=ichan.   However in some cases ic>ichan, and hence it would not find the appropriate sideband in doing the check. (It would miss the channel number it was called with.) The routine was changed to start at 1.
Bug check:  Easiest to see the effect if you change the order of the 'codes' lines in a sked file.
