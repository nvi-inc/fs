This file contains a summary of changes made and why.

2015Jan29.  
../vmoinp.f  2014Dec09 change removed. Now all sidebands are treated as if normal LO. 
proc_disk_trakcs.f:   Flip sideband if inverted LOs. 
     
proc_trkf.f           Flip sideband for VEX if inverted LO. Previously only did for SKD files
proc_ifd.f            Added warning message if it doesn't find any valid LO inputs.
proc_mracks_vc.f      Added support for inverted Los. 
proc_disk_tracks.f, proc_trakcs.f 
                      Also added "ignore_mark5b_bad_mask"  flag. If mask is bad, will issue warning and continue. 
                      User needs to set flag in $misc section of skedf.ctl
procs.f               Previously did silent 'abort' if BBC frequencies were wrong. Now mushes on.

Modifications to support astro2 and astro3 modes with DBBC 
BW written out to 3 places. Abort conditions all go to label 900.

../skdrut/gnpas.f

2014Jun02 proc_mracks_vc.f
This routine is called: call proc_mracks_vc(icode,ic,ib,ichan)
ic=channel #
ib=BBC #

The main idea is that this routine cycles through all channels one at a time and write lines like:
vc11=245.99,8.00,u
or
vc01=210.00,8.0,ul


To determine whether to write out "u", "l", or "ul" it checks to see if there are any channels that have the same channel # and bbc # that it was called with.  The code fragment that did the checking was:
        DO ichanx=ic,nchan(istn,icode) !remaining channels
           icx=invcx(ichanx,istn,icode) ! channel number
           if (ib.eq.ibbcx(icx,istn,icode)) then ! Same BBC?               
             if(itras(1,1,1,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99 .or. 
     >          itras(1,1,2,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99) ku=.true. 
             if(itras(2,1,1,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99 .or.
     >          itras(2,1,2,icx,1,istn,icode).ne.-99) kl=.true.                  
           endif
        enddo

This normally works because usually ic=ichan.   However in some cases ic>ichan, and hence it would not find the appropriate sideband in doing the check. (It would miss the channel number it was called with.) The routine was changed to start at 1.
Bug check:  Easiest to see the effect if you change the order of the 'codes' lines in a sked file.
