! write out commands that look something like this:
!>>    fila10g_mode=,0x55555555,,16.00
!>>     fila10g_mode
!>>     mk5c_mode=vdif,0x55555555,,16.00

! NOTE: fila10g mask is split in two:  32-bit High order and 32-bit low order. High order goes first.      
!       for the other modes, just one 64bit word (if  applicable).
