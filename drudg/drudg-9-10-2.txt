Drudg release notes 9.10.2
Date of release is 2007-Dec-27.

1. Fixed a problem where the rack type specified in skedf.ctl had
to be in upper case.  Is now case insensitive.

2. PROC.  Removed all the "mk5=" commands from "exper_initi". These
now need to be put in the ready_disk procedure.

3. SNAP. Moved "ready_disk" before the first "setup" command.

4. Labels.  Fixed a problem where the left hand side of labels
were being cut off.
