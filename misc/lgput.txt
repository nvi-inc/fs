Hi,

  If anyone is interested I wrote a small script 'lgput' which I
attach to this email. I keep it in /usr2/st/bin, chmod og+rwx

  You can call it from the Field System with a procedure 'sendlog'
called from 'sched_end' like this -

sendlog
!+10s

Procedure 'sendlog is then :

   "send the logfile to vlbeer 081211
  sy =exec lgput `lognm`.log cm &

  No doubt script experts will want to improve it, but it seems to
have worked well enough for a while. I also have another one to send
the tsys files.

  Note: it works out the upload directory from the current month.

Cheers
Paul
