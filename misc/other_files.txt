		  Other Files that affect the Field System

INTRODUCTION

This short document is intended to provide a list (expected to be
incomplete at this time) of other files that either directly or
indirectly impact FS operations.  The list may be expanded from
time-to-time.  This document describes the relevant files for FS Linux
Distrubtion 5 (based on Debian "woody"), the current standard
distribution.

USER FILES

~/.fvwm2rc    - sets menu options and hot-key sequences for fvwm2
~/.fvwmrc     - sets menu options and hot-key sequences for (obsolete fvwm)
~/.Xresources - defines window placements, colors, and features
~/.xsession   - sets-up login_shell window and screen blanking time
~/.profile    - bash start-up script read by .xsession

SHELL START-UP FILES

Which files are important depend on what shell you use. You should see
the FILES section (and other sections as well) of the "man" page for
your shell, e.g., "man tcsh" (if you don't know what login shell you
have, use "chsh" without changing the shell to see, check "man
chsh"). There are many shells and each typically has many options, not
all of which are used or needed. For FS standard shell "tcsh", the
following are usually used:

~/.login  - defines environment variables and path for login shells
~/.chsrc  - defines aliases for login and sub-shells

For "bash", the simplest set-up is to just use:

~/.profile - user specific login shell start-up script

NTP

/etc/ntp.conf            - defines NTP configuration
/etc/default/ntp-servers - defines NTP servers for ntpdate boot script
