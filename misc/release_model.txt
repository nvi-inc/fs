Version 0.2 - Apr 2020

= Straw man Release Model

This document briefly describes the version tags, release model, and branches
used in the FS git repo. It also outlines the steps in initial and update
installs of the FS, including from an archive, and sending changes to the
maintainers.

== Version tags

An example version tag is:

   10.1.0-beta1

The general form of FS version tags is:

   VERSION.SUBLEVEL.PATCHLEVEL-STRING

Where:

   VERSION, a number, indicates a major release, e.g., '10'.  Note that VERSION
   does not start with a 'v'.

   SUBLEVEL, a number, indicates a minor release, e.g., '1'.

   PATCHLEVEL, a number, indicate the patch number, e.g., '0'. Non-zero patch
   numbers are only used for fixes to VERSION.SUBLEVEL releases (before version
   '10.0.0', non-zero PATCHLEVELS were used in regular releases).

   STRING, a string, which is optional and when non-blank provides
   additional information, e.g., 'beta1'. If STRING is empty the dash "-" is
   omitted.

When the FS is "made", the version tag is inserted in the FS (and 'drudg') code
and compiled in, if it has changed since the last time the FS was "made".  If
the version that is "made" does not correspond to a tagged commit, additional
information is automatically appended to identify the specific commit, e.g.:

  10.0.0-beta1-58-g229f696e

The general form of what is appended is:

  -n-gSHA-dirty

where:

   n is the number of commits that have been been made since the last
   commit tagged with a version string, e.g., 58.

   SHA is the (unique) SHA prefix of this commit, e.g., 229f696e.

   -dirty is appended if the working directory contains changes that
   have not been committed. When -dirty appears, the ability to identify
   what version was run is lost. This should be avoided.

This format is only guaranteed to be present for versions '10.0.0-alpha2'
and later.

== Release Model

When an FS release is made, a particular commit is tagged with the version. A
lightweight tag is sufficient, but an annotated tag can be used.  Official
releases never have a non-blank STRING.  However, alpha and beta releases will
have appropriate STRING values, e.g. 'alpha1', 'beta2', etc.  Other values may
be used as needed.

There is a basic distinction between VERSION.SUBLEVEL.0. i.e., with zero
PATCHLEVEL, or "feature" releases, and ones with non-zero PATCHLEVEL, which are
"patch" releases.  Generally feature releases include significant feature
changes, but also occur when a patch is not just a "quick" install for the
users. A patch that requires significant changes, including, but not limited to
reboots due to changes in shared memory size, should be promoted to being a
feature release. The goal is that patch releases should be safe for operational
stations to install without a significant amount of time, testing, and being a
risk to operations.

For each release, there should be an "update" notice
fsVERSION.SUBLEVEL.PATCHLEVELup.txt (hearafter fs<tag>up.txt) file in
'/usr2/fs/misc', documenting the changes in the version and installation
instructions. Note that there are no files with -string in <tag>, at least for
alpha and beta releases. For feature releases, the file should have a complete
description of the changes and installation instructions from the previous
feature release. For patch releases, the description and instructions should be
complete for an update from the corresponding feature release and include those
instructions (by reference). Note that feature release should include
instructions to use (by reference) for the last patch of the previous feature
release, unless they have no impact on the installation of the new feature
release from the previous one.

== Branches

The main branch in the repo is 'master'. This is the branch that is checked out
after a clone operation from gitbub.  The 'master' branch represents the main
line of development and should include most of the feature releases. Typically,
patch releases will not occur on 'master'.  However, if a patch is needed and
there have been no changes on 'master' since the corresponding feature release,
the patch can be  released on the 'master' (probably have been developed on a
"feature" branch first). Otherwise, a "maintenance" branch should be made from
the corresponding feature release, e.g., to create such a branch for feature
release 10.2:

   git checkout -b 10.2 10.2.0

Despite feature releases normally being on the 'master' branch, a feature
release may occur on a different branch for a patch that has been promoted to a
feature release.  In this case, a maintenance branch for new feature release is
created at the tip of the existing maintenance branch, if it exists. For
example to make a 10.3 maintenance branch from the 10.2 maintenance branch:

   git checkout 10.2
   git checkout -b 10.3

and the new feature release is place on the new branch. If no maintenance
branch exists for the previous feature branch, it can be created at that point:

   git checkout -b 10.3 10.2.0

The changes for either type of maintenance release should be rebased onto
'master' as soon as possible, unless they were created there first.

It may make sense to retain maintenance branches long term, if for no other
reason that it will easier to find a tagged releases on that branch if the
version tag was accidentally deleted.

Generally speaking, all other branches are feature or bug fix branches. Once
they are considered to be stabilized enough they are merged into the
appropriate branch, 'master' or a maintenance branch, and then deleted.

Commits that do not have a version tag are not considered releases.  Users can
check them out, but they may have bugs and/or incompatibilities with local
files and station software of the previous tagged version.  The
last commit on a <branch>, the tip, is checked out with:

    git checkout <branch>

It is always possible to get a specific release version by checking
out the <tag> for its version string:

    git checkout <tag>

It is not necessary that unreleased commits on 'master' or a maintenance branch
be in a state that is releasable. However, it is helpful to developers, and to
a lessor extent for users, for the branch tips be in a usable state. This is
largely achieved by not merging or rebasing feature branches into the branch
that aren't in a fairly complete state.  However, it is acceptable to make new
comments significantly changing the impact of previous commits, if they still
result in a usable tip.

== Making a release

Before a release is made, the update notes should be prepared. They should be
in a file named /usr2/fs/misc/fs<tag>up.txt (no -alpha or -beta strings in
<tag>). For feature releases, the instructions should include all steps to
upgrade from the previous feature release. If there were significant changes in
patch releases for that version, they can be included by reference to the last
patch release instructions at the time of the new feature release. A
description of the changes should be included as well.

For patch releases, the installation instructions can be abbreviated to cover
just what is necessary to upgrade from the corresponding feature and all
previous patches for that feature release.  A description of what has been
fixed should included. Covering all the previous patch releases, should not be
hard, since previous patch notes can be included explicitly.

To make a release:

. Finalize release, including release notes, committing all changes.
. git push
. Tag the commit with version tag
. git push --tags
. On the github page for the repo, select "release"
. Select "Draft a new release"
. Enter version string as an existing tag and select branch
. Enter title and description
  (do not include "pre-release or the version tag in title since they are automatically prepended)
. If not for production, select "This is a pre-release"
. Select "Publish Release"

== Installation 

To find the most recent release for installation, go to:

https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/releases

Typically, you should use the most recent feature release, i.e., version string
ending in zero, for versions starting with '10' or later, e.g., '10.0.0'.
Versions with a trailing *-string* are not intended for production. If there is
a more recent patch release for the latest feature release, use that most
recent patch release.  Use the tag of the release you have chosen for <tag> in
the instructions below.

=== First time FS installation

As 'root', execute: 

.   cd /usr2
.   git clone https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs fs-git
.   cd fs-git
.   git checkout <tag>
.   make install
    (answer 'y' to confirm installation)
.   (log out as 'root' and log in as 'prog')
.   make >&/dev/null
.   make -s
    (if there is no output from the above command, then the 'make' was successful)
.   reboot

You can then login as 'oper' and run the FS, but you will need to
customize the control files in '/usr2/control' before you can do
anything useful. Additionally, you may need to add station software,
particularly 'antcn' if you want to control an antenna

=== Installing FS Updates

As 'prog':

.   cd /usr2/fs-git
.   git pull
.   git checkout <tag>
.   make >&/dev/null
.   make -s
    (if there is no output of the above command, then the 'make' was successful)

Additionally, you will need to follow installation instructions in the
/usr2/fs/misc.fs<tag>up.txt for the release you have selected.

=== Installing from an archive

The main method of distributing the FS is with the git repo. That will
make updates, particularly patches,  much easier. However, if it is
not possible to use git, you can get a '.tar.gz' archive from the
release page.

To install from the archive:

.   (log in as 'root')
.   cd /tmp
.   wget https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/archive/<tag>.tar.gz
.   cd /usr2
.   tar -xzf /tmp/<tag>.tar.gz
.   cd /usr2/fs-<tag>
.   make install
    (answer 'y' to confirm installation)
.   (log out as 'root' and log in as 'prog')
.   make >&/dev/null
.   make -s
    (if there is no output of the above command, then the 'make' was successful)

If this is a first time installation, you can then login as 'oper' and
run the FS, but you will need to customize the control files in
'/usr2/control' before you can do anything useful.  Additionally, you
may need to add station software, particularly 'antcn' if you want to
control an antenna.

If this an update, you will need to follow installation instructions in the
/usr2/fs/misc/fs<tag>up.txt for the release you have selected.

== Managing testing of FS Updates

To be written ...

== Users sending code changes to developer

TBD: patches? fork/pull-request?. It would be good to preserve commit SHAs
for tracing versions using stations, if possible.
