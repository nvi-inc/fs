			  lo_config command

The "lo_config" command is intended only for stations that use a local
"lo=..." command to set their LOs under schedule control and need to
avoid sending individual commands for each LO used for a given
mode. In this case they can use the "lo_config" command to set all LOs
at one time.  The "lo_config" command is a local station implemented
command only.

Use of the "lo_config" command by DRUDG in experiment procedure files
is enabled with the "LO_CONFIG" keyword in the
"/usr2/control/skedf.ctl" control file.  Please see
"/usr2/fs/st.default/control/skedf.ctl" for an example.

If "lo_config" is enabled in "skedf.ctl", DRUDG will append an
"lo_config" command at the end of every IF set-up procedure it
generates.  The intent is to give a signal when the entire LO
configuration for a mode has been defined so that just one transaction
can used to set the local LO control system, instead of one
transaction for each "LO=..." command.

Please note that if "lo_config" is used, any local IF set-up
procedures should be updated to use it.  In addition if any manual
"lo=..." commands are given, it will be necessary to manually issue an
"lo_config" command to cause an effect.

It is recommended that a "/usr2/st/help/lo_config.___" file be created
with help information for use with the help command.

Due to the fact that using "lo_config" makes manually configuring the
LOs a two step process, is recommended that it only be implemented if
it is necessary.
