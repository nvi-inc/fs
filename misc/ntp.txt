			 NTP recommendations

This document contains recommendations for set-up and use of NTP for
robust FS operations.  The last item (5) is the most important.

1. Use the 'computer' model in 'time.ctl':

* rate (secs/day)  span (hours)  model (none/offset/rate/computer)
*                                      (use "rate"; only use "computer"
*                                       if FS can't read time from
*                                       rack/recorder)
    0.000          1.000         computer

2. In 'ntp.conf':

   2a. Use a mix of local and remote servers, as many as you can, up
       to 10.  These are preferably stratum 1 servers, but
       _independent_ stratum 2s can be used to fill-in.  You should
       try for as many stratum 1s as you can.  NTP strongly prefers to
       have at least three servers and you should try to have at least
       three local ones if you can in case of Internet outages.

   2b. In the 'ntp.conf' file, only list servers by their IP
       addresses.  This makes it more robust if there is a DNS outage.
       You can include a comment line to help identify each server in
       the file.

   2c. Use 'iburst minpoll 4' for each stratum 1 (or 2) server to
       speed-up initial sync. A report of an 'ntpd' bug:

         https://blog.ntpsec.org/2017/09/19/jitter-bug-perfume.html

       may help explain some of NTP's strange start-up behavior. One
       thing that has been noticed is that it prefers local servers at
       start-up, but will eventually sync to a better remote server.

   2d. Use 'restrict' with 'kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery' for
       security from each server.

       The overall result for a server is typically something like
       this for each NTP server:

#  node.domain
server      192.5.41.209 iburst minpoll 4
restrict    192.5.41.209 kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery

   2e. Use 'noselect' instead of 'iburst minpoll 4' for monitoring
       (only) of local devices.

   2f. Serve other devices on the local network, with something like:

# serve this private subnet
restrict 192.168.1.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap

3. 'ntpd' vs 'ntpdate'

   In the old days if the time from the hardware clock was very far
   off, NTP would not adjust the time. 'ntpdate' was used to get close
   first.  More recently the 'ntpd' daemon seems to handle this if
   started with '-g' option.  That is probably the standard
   configuration for most systems now, but it might be worth checking
   if your system is set-up this way.  A big advantage of '-g' over
   early versions of 'ntpdate' is that it will use the servers already
   configured in 'ntp.conf'. Some later versions of 'ntpdate' may also
   do that.

4. 'check_ntp' SNAP procedure

   4a. Have the 'check_ntp' procedure in the 'station' procedure
       library:

sy=popen 'uptime 2>&1' -n uptime &
sy=popen 'ntpq -np 2>&1|grep -v "^[- x#]" 2>&1' -n ntpq &

       'popen' is available in all FS versions starting with
       9.11.9. See 'help=sy' for details on its use.

   4b. Put a call to 'check_ntp' at the end of 'initi' for a visible
       initial check at FS start up.

   4c. Put a call to 'check_ntp' at the start of 'exper_initi' to
       record the ntp state in the experiment log at the experiment
       start (and restarts) for troubleshooting.

5. Make sure NTP is synced before operations are started.

   After a FS start, particularly after a computer boot, operations
   should not start until the 'check_ntp' output shows a server with a
   '*' in column one of the 'ntpq' output.  That is the server the
   daemon is synced with.  The operator can run 'check_ntp' manually
   as many times as necessary if the output of 'initi' does not show
   an initial sync.  It should sync quickly if 'ntp.conf' is
   configured as described above.  Ideally the offsets, the next to
   last column of the 'ntpq' output, should all be a few milliseconds
   or less.
