	     End User Set-up for GSFC Checked-out FS PC

Welcome to your new FS PC!  You have a base FSL7 with the latest FS
installed but not customized.  Please use this document to guide the
set-up of your PC.  The ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF section at end of this
document should be read carefully.

  [Although this document is intended for users setting up a new PC,
  this document is also useful for customization by stations that are
  upgrading an existing computer from a previous FS Linux distribution
  to FSL7.  Additional notes and comments for this case are included
  in the steps below enclosed in square brackets '[]' and indented
  like this paragraph.  Please read the complete instructions for each
  step below to check whether there are any special steps (in
  brackets) when upgrading before following the instructions for the
  step.  Please also be sure to read the ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF section
  at end of this document.  If you are upgrading your PC, please
  follow the instructions in the FSL7_Upgrade.txt document before
  using this document.  Make sure your computer is connected to the
  network, if you are using one, then skip ahead to step 9 below.]

In addition to the computer components, you should have received:

____ Etch DVDs
____ FSL7Install CD, which contains the latest versions of:
     fs7linux_DVD.txt, fs7.selections, fsadapt-*.tgz, fs-*.tgz,
     fs*up.txt, FSL7_PC_Checkout.txt, FSL7_Upgrade.txt,
     FSL7_End_User.txt, RAID.txt the *.deb files needed for Pgperl,
     and any special instructions, drivers or other files for your
     system.  The contents of this CD will help you to make a complete
     re-install even if you don't have an Internet connection and/or
     lose the hard copy of these documents.
____ fs7linux_DVD.txt print-out.
____ Special instructions for this system, in document: _______________.
____ Completed Check-out document Checklist, with annotations
____ End User Set-up Checklist, (this document)

The computer components and any extra items specific to this system
should be listed on the Check-out Checklist.

If you need to do a complete re-install, check for any special
instructions for your system (usually named "motherboard.txt", where
"motherboard" is the model of your motherboard).  If you find special
instructions, follow them.  If you don't find special instructions,
follow the instructions in fs7linux.txt.  The "INSTALLATION" and
"CUSTOMIZATION" sections of FSL7_Upgrade.txt may prove helpful for
some of the associated activities needed for a complete install.

The Set-up Checklist follows:

____ 1. Assemble your PC

____ 2. Make sure the PC is not connected to the network

____ 3. Power it up.

____ 4. Switch to vt1 <Ctrl><Alt><F1>

____ 5. Log in as "root", the system was shipped with a root password
        of "vlbIcdp1".

____ 6. Change the root password using the "passwd" command. Be sure
        to use a strong password.

     7. Create strong passwords for the "oper" and "prog" accounts:

        ____  passwd oper
        ____  passwd prog
   
____ 8. Switch to the X-display <Ctrl><Alt><F7>. If the display is not
        correct or if you are supplying your own monitor, you should
        adjust the X display settings. To do this return to
        vt1 <Ctrl><Alt><F1> and run:

         dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg

       You can accept the defaults for everything, but to adjust the
       monitor definition, you can try the Monitor Autodetect option
       (don't confuse this with autodetecting the video hardware,
       which comes first, just accept the default for the hardware
       detection option).  If that doesn't work, you can do another
       reconfiguration, this time disabling the monitor autodetection,
       select the advanced configuration, answering "Generic Monitor"
       for the monitor identification, then selecting advanced set-up.
       no resolution greater than 1024x768, horizontal frequencies of
       28-51, and vertical 43-60 will return the system to the
       configuration it arrived with.  You can try other
       configurations depending on the specifications of your monitor,
       you may especially want to enable higher resolutions if your
       monitor supports them.

       If the autodetection of the video hardware doesn't give you the
       results you want, you could try selecting "No" for that and
       then selecting "vesa" as your driver.

       After reconfiguring the X server, switch back to X display
       <Ctrl><Alt><F7> and restart the X server
       <Ctrl><Alt><Backspace>.  If the gdm login comes up successfully
       and after logging in as "prog", the display is acceptable, you
       are done with X set-up.  Please log-out from the login shell on
       the X display.

9. Set-up your printers.

   ____ 9a. Connect your printers to the computer.

              [Existing computers being upgraded may have parallel
              ports and these can continue to be used.]

            Newer computers probably do not have a parallel port (IEEE
            1284).  If not, and your printer requires a parallel
            connection, you should be able to obtain a USB/Parallel
            converter locally for less than US$20.

   ____ 9b. Login in to the X-display <Ctrl><Alt><F7> as "oper".

   ____ 9c. Start firefox by entering:

              firefox

   ____ 9d. Enter URL: http://localhost:631

   ____ 9e. Select "Administration" tab.

   ____ 9f. Add the printers.  

              [If you are upgrading an existing computer you may be
              able to get useful printer configuration information
              from the /etc/printcap file or the files in /etc/cups
              directory on your old computer.  You should either be
              able to examine these files on your old operational disk
              or from the "etc" archive you made from that disk.
              Assuming the archive has been placed on /tmp on the new
              computer, you can extract the files for examination in
              the /tmp directory using the commands:

                cd /tmp
                tar xzf etc.tgz etc/printcap

              or

                cd /tmp
                tar xzf etc.tgz etc/cups
              ]

            Connected printers may be automatically offered to be
            added. You will need to supply the root account and
            password for validation as part of the printer management
            process.  If CUPS offers you the wrong type of printer to
            be automatically added or it is unclear what driver to
            select for a printer, you may be able to get some useful
            information to help with manually installing your printer
            by searching the WWW for the string "cups" and your
            printer model.

            Be sure to select a printer as the default.

   ____ 9g. Quit firefox.

   ____ 9h. Log-out as "oper".

   ____ 9i. If you want simpler device names than the CUPS system uses
            for automatically configured printers, then on vt1
            <Ctrl><Alt><F1> as "root" edit the file
            /etc/cups/printers.conf and change the "..."  (name) in
            the <Printer ...> lines and in the ppd/ sub-directory
            rename the corresponding files, then:

              invoke-rc.d cupsys restart         

____ 10. Return to vt1 <Ctrl><Alt><F1>. Change directory to the
         fsadapt sub-directory:

           cd /root/fsadapt

____ 11. Set your network parameters,

           [Existing computers being upgraded from previous versions
           of FS Linux should already have their network parameters
           defined and so can skip this step.]

          Run the "netconfig" script and answer the questions:

            ./netconfig

____ 12. Generate ssh system keys.

           [Existing systems being upgraded from previous versions of
           FS Linux can either use the new keys already generating in
           the update process or delete those keys and transfer the
           keys from the old system to maintain compatibility with
           other systems expecting the same keys.  You can use the
           "etc" archive, created as part of the upgrade process, as
           described in step 12B below.  If you will use the keys
           already generated, skip to step (13).  If you want to use
           old keys, then before install them according to 12B below,
           delete the already generated keys, as "root":

             cd /etc/ssh
             rm *key *key.pub
           
           Note an upgraded system will normally already have a
           running network connection at this point.]

         You have two choices here, either (A) generate hew keys or
         (B) use existing keys from a previous system that is being
         replaced or upgraded.

         (A) To generate new keys, as "root":

               dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

         (B) To install old key from a system being replaced or
             upgraded, first make an archive of the /etc directory on
             the old computer, as "root":

               cd /
               tar czf /tmp/etc.tgz etc

             If the archive is too large to place on your old
             computer's /tmp directory, you can place it somewhere
             else where there is more room, perhaps /usr2.  Then copy
             the archive to the /tmp directory of the new computer and
             execute these commands as "root":

               cd /tmp
               tar xzf /tmp/etc.tgz etc/ssh
               cd /tmp/etc/ssh
               cp -a *key *key.pub /etc/ssh
               invoke-rc.d ssh restart         

             If the method you want to use to copy the archive to /tmp
             is the over the network (a CD, DVD, or USB drive would
             work instead) and you do not already have a running
             network connection (i.e. this is new system), you will
             need to wait until after you have rebooted in step 15
             below to make the transfer.  If that is the case, you
             should generate temporary keys according to step 12A and
             then after step (15) below, execute as "root":

               cd /etc/ssh
               rm *key *key.pub

             to delete the temporary keys before using the
             instructions above in this step (12B) to copy the old
             keys from the archive.

____ 13. Set hosts.deny and hosts.allow.

         [Systems being upgraded will not already have the shown
         contents of hosts.deny.  For upgraded systems, the file
         should be modified to agree with these contents.]

         These files define how TCP wrappers control access to the
         machine over the network.  As delivered, this is set as
         restrictively as possible with /etc/hosts.allow only
         containing comments and /etc/hosts.deny set to:

ALL: PARANOID
#
ALL: ALL

         You may wish to allow incoming connections in
         /etc/hosts.allow.  The syntax of "hosts.deny" and
         "hosts.allow" is documented in "man 5 hosts_access".  We
         recommend that your changes are only to add:

sshd: node

         lines to hosts.allow for specific hosts.  This will allow
         selective incoming ssh access.

____ 14. If the machine resides on a network with NTP available,
         please configure NTP.  If need be, this step can be deferred
         until a convenient time.

         You should use a set of up to 10 NTP servers, some local and
         some remote.  At least one should be local if possible, but
         having a few is better.  A few should be remote if possible.
         The idea is to give NTP a population of servers to analyze in
         order to pick the best one.  Local servers, besides having a
         shorter round-trip communication delay are available if the
         connection to the wider network should fail. The remote
         servers, when available, normally provide a reality check on
         the local servers, but in some cases may be better.  A TAC
         running TAC32+ with the NTP server function enabled is
         suitable as a local server.  If you do not already have a
         list of NTP servers to use, you may be able to get
         suggestions from:
         http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome.

           [If you are upgrading from a previous version of FS Linux
           you can recover the NTP servers from the old system.  To
           list the previous NTP servers, extract the NTP
           configuration file from the "etc" archive made during the
           upgrade process, assume the archive is on /tmp, execute
           these commands as "root":

             cd /tmp
             tar xzf /tmp/etc.tgz etc/ntp.conf
             grep ^server ntp.conf

           Then continue with rest of the instructions in this step.]

         Once you determine a list of servers, you should put them in
         /etc/ntp.conf on "server" lines, in place of the default
         "server" lines. You will also need to add a "restrict" line
         with the "kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery" qualification
         for each server. for example (white space added for clarity):

server   timehost.gsfc.nasa.gov
restrict timehost.gsfc.nasa.gov kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   godz.gsfc.nasa.gov
restrict godz.gsfc.nasa.gov     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   tacggao.gsfc.nasa.gov
restrict tacggao.gsfc.nasa.gov  kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   ntp2.usno.navy.mil
restrict ntp2.usno.navy.mil     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   navobs1.gatech.edu
restrict navobs1.gatech.edu     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   tick.usno.navy.mil
restrict tick.usno.navy.mil     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery

         These changes will take effect the next time the system is
         booted or you can use:

           invoke-rc.d ntp restart         
 
         If you sometimes suffer loss of connection to your domain
         name servers, typically because they are off site, you should
         use IP addresses of the servers instead of their node names.

____ 15. Connect the machine to the network and reboot.

           [If you are upgrading an existing computer, this step is
           probably not needed since it is probably already connected
           to and accessing the network.]

____ 16. Customize the FS for your station.  If this computer is
         replacing a computer where the FS is already set-up for your
         station or you are upgrading to FSL7, please follow the steps
         in this section.  If the computer is for a new installation,
         please skip to the step 17.

         For a replacement computer or FSL7 upgrade, please take the
         following steps:

           [If you are upgrading your existing computer, please skip
           step 16a.  These archives were already made as part of the
           upgrade process.]

    ____ 16a. On your old computer, make a back-up of your station
              software as "root":

                cd /usr2
                tar czf /tmp/usr2.tgz control log proc sched st-* st

              If you have a lot of customization in oper and prog
              directories, you can copy them by making another
              archive.  You can use, as "root":

                tar czf /tmp/operprog.tgz oper prog

              Please note that if the archive files are too large to
              fit on /tmp, you can make them somewhere else where is
              more space, possibly /usr2, and/or you may need to only
              archive only a subset of the contents of the
              directories.

    ____ 16b. Place the usr2.tgz (and operprog.tgz, if you made one)
              file on the /tmp/ directory of your new computer via
              whatever means is convenient, usually _getting_ them
              using ftp or scp over the network (start the operation
              _from_ the new machine: incoming ftp and ssh are
              disabled by default).

    ____ 16c. As "root", remove the default FS files provided and
              replace them with the files from the old system.

                cd /usr2
                \rm -rf control proc st-* st
                tar xzpf /tmp/usr2.tgz

              If you made an operprog.tgz file, expand it into /tmp:
 
                cd /tmp
                tar xzpf /tmp/operprog.tgz

              and copy or merge the files you need into the files
              directories of "oper" and "prog".  This should be done
              carefully to avoid losing new default versions of the
              files in these directories.  You can use the "diff"
              command to compare the new default files to your old
              versions to get an idea of how to merge the two
              versions.  Typically the "oper" and "prog" versions of
              the ".fvwm2rc" and ".Xresources" file are the most
              important files to recover.

    ____ 16d. You will need to make your control files, SNAP
              procedures, and station software agree with the version
              of the FS on your new computer.  There are three
              possible cases: (1) the FS version on the new computer
              is older than the one on our old computer, (2) the FS
              version on the new computer is same as the one on our
              old computer, and (3) the FS version on the new computer
              is newer than the one on our old computer.  Follow the
              appropriate instructions below for your case:

             (1) If the FS version on the new computer is older than
                 the one on our old computer, you should install the
                 source from the latest version as described in that
                 version's update notice, then proceed with option (2)
                 or (3) below as appropriate.

             (2) If the FS version on the new computer is same as the
                 one on our old computer, relatively little needs to
                 be done.

                 Login in as "prog" and compile your local software:

                   cd /usr2/st
                   make rmdoto rmexe all

                 The new C compiler is stricter about some things and
                 may require you to make some changes to your source
                 code in order for it to compile.  Warnings, as
                 opposed to actual errors, can probably be ignored for
                 now, but should be dealt with eventually.  Typically
                 they are related to missing '#include' files and can
                 lead to subtle (new or old) bugs, so should not be
                 ignored for very long.  They are usually easy to fix.

             (3) If the FS version on the new computer is newer than
                 the one on our old computer, you should update your
                 control files, SNAP procedures as described in the
                 update notice in /usr2/fs/misc. The update notice
                 file name is of the form: "fs*up.txt".  You should
                 use the most recent update notice, which should
                 correspond to the FS version installed.  Please also
                 see the comment about the stricter compilers in case
                 (2) above.

         16d. The system items that may have changed as part of moving
              to the new computer are:

         ____ (1) The serial port devices. On the new system these
                  are /dev/ttyS4 through /dev/ttyS11. You may need to
                  adjust your dev.ctl control file depending on which
                  serial ports you use for which devices.

         ____ (2) The PCI-GPIB board name on the new system is
                  "gpib0". You may need to adjust the GPIB entry in
                  the dev.ctl control file to reflect this.

         ____ (3) New print2dymo script.  Please follow the
                  instructions in /usr2/fs/st.default/skedf.ctl to
                  set-up a new print2dymo on your new computer, using
                  your computer's Dymo printer name in place of "Dymo"
                  in "lpr -P Dymo".  Please note the syntax of the
                  "-P" parameter may be different for FSL7 than what
                  you used before, i.e. needs a space after the "P".

    ____ 16e. Any station software you have that runs outside of the
              FS, including daemons that are started at boot time,
              such as tacdclient, metserver, and metclient will need
              to be set-up.  Please refer to the corresponding
              documentation on how to do this.  The documentation and
              default source for tacdclient, metserver, and metclient
              is included the corresponding sub-directories of
              /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0.  FS version 9.10.3 (or
              later) include modifications to the default source code
              to support use with FSL7.  You should compare the new
              source to your old source to see what needs to be
              changed.

    ____ 16f. Reboot your system.

    ____ 16g. Test the FS to verify that it works, including printing
              labels and schedule listings and running part of a
              schedule as a test.  You should pay special attention to
              whether all GPIB devices work since the FSL7 driver may
              have problems with some older devices. If you have some
              GPIB device that the new driver cannot communicate with,
              please contact Ed (Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov); you may want to
              consider getting a National Instruments 779732-x to
              allow all your GPIB devices to be supported.

         After completing this section, jump ahead to step 18.

____ 17. New station set-up. A new station set-up will require
         customizing the control files in /usr2/control, particularly:
         antenna.ctl, location.ctl, dev.ctl, ibad.ctl, and mk5ad.ctl.
         You will need to select the correct version of station.prc to
         copy to /usr2/proc.  You can find a table of the different
         versions of station.prc in the introductory remarks of the
         latest FS upgrade notice, for example
         "/usr2/fs/miscfs9103up.txt".

         It is not necessary now, but in the long run it is desirable
         to develop a station specific "antcn" program.  This can be
         done by modifying the code in /usr2/st/antcn to suit your
         antenna.  Keeping your "antcn" program (and any other local
         software) in the "/usr2/st" directory tree instead of the
         "/usr2/fs" tree will make FS upgrades much easier to install
         and no functionality will be lost.  More information is
         available from Ed (Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov) on both customizing
         the control files and developing an "antcn".

____ 18. Configure e-mail.

           [If you are upgrading a computer with a previous version of
           FS Linux, the contents of the old exim configuration may
           help you to customize the new version.  To extract the exim
           configuration file from the "etc" archive made during the
           upgrade process, assuming the archive is on /tmp, execute
           these commands as "root":

              cd /tmp
              tar xzf etc.tgz etc/exim/exim.conf

           ]

         If you want something other than the default installation,
         which is local mail only, you will need to do (as "root"):

           dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config

         to change the set-up. Typically you would select "internet
         site" and defaults for all the other prompts.  If you want to
         receive incoming mail, you will also need to enable SMTP
         connections in Window 4a of fsadapt.  We recommend that you
         not receive incoming mail on this computer.  If you follow
         this recommendation, you should set the "reply-to" address
         for outgoing messages to a real e-mail account at your
         institution that is read regularly.  You can do this by added
         a line (as "root") like:

            *@node.doman email@address Ffr

         to the "rewrite" rules section of
         /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template if you selected one big
         configuration file or in
         /etc/exim4/conf.d/rewrite/31_exim4-config_rewriting if you
         selected several small files.  Where "node.domain" is the
         fully qualified node-name of this computer and "email@address"
         is the e-mail address you want replies to be addressed
         to. Then execute:

             invoke-rc.d exim4 restart

         If you have made the above changes to direct replies to other
         e-mail accounts, you may want to customize the User Name (not
         login name, this is the fifth field) of "root", "prog", and
         "oper" in /etc/passwd to append a string like "at
         node.domain", where node.domain is this machine, e.g., for
         atri.gsfc.nasa.gov you might change the 5th field for "oper"
         from

           oper

         to

           oper at atri.gsfc.nasa.gov

         This will help the recipient (possibly you) determine which
         system generated this message since it may not be obvious to
         the recipient.  This configuration ("Internet site" in the
         exim4 configuration, no incoming mail, rewrite rules for
         reply, and modified user names), provides good support of the
         FS "msg" utility.

____ 19. Weekly updates. If your computer is connected to the
         Internet, you should enable weekly security updates in Window
         2 of fsadapt (all steps in the section must be done as
         "root"):

           cd /root/fsadapt
           ./fsadapt

         Hit return on the first screen and "skip" on "Window 1" then
         "OK", then set _only_ "updates" on "Window 2", then "OK",
         then "Cancel" on "Window 3".

           [If you are upgrading an existing computer, you may have
           already performed the next action, configured
           sources.lists, as part of the upgrade process.]

         You should edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file and move the
         "deb http..." and #deb-src http..." lines before "deb
         cdrom..." lines.  This will save you from possibly having to
         insert DVDs (or CDs), if you ever want to install a new
         package.  You can change the line with "http.us.debian.org"
         to use any convenient local mirror which should improve speed
         compared to the default.  The line with "security.debian.org"
         must not be changed.

         Make a check for any updates currently needed:

           apt-get update
           /etc/cron.weekly/apt-get

         If any updates are needed, instructions are displayed, follow
         them.  This usually means entering:

           apt-get -uy upgrade
           apt-get clean

         For some motherboards it may be necessary to re-install
         special drivers, please see any special documentation that
         came with your system.

         After the updates have been enabled, the Debian security
         archive will be automatically checked weekly for needed
         updates.  If there are any security updates that need to be
         applied, an e-mail will be sent to "root", usually forwarded
         to "oper".  The account receiving these e-mails must be
         checked weekly.  The e-mail contains instructions on how to
         install the updates.

ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF

This section covers some issue you should be aware of when dealing
with your FSL7 system.

1. If your system is connected to the Internet, it is imperative that
   you enable weekly updates, as described above, check the e-mail
   account that the messages about updates are sent to, and apply the
   updates in a timely fashion.  Once the Linux distribution is no
   longer current, new security updates should continue to be
   available for another year.  Before that year expires, you should
   develop a plan and implement it to transition to the new current
   version *or* remove the machine from the network.

2. By default, all e-mail is local only.  All "root" and "prog" e-mail
   is sent to "oper".  It is important that "oper" check e-mail
   regularly for important system messages.  It is also important that
   e-mail to this account is NOT forwarded to another machine so that
   if a problem develops with the network, it will still be possible
   to get e-mailed error messages.  Please be sure there is a line:

     test ! -f /var/mail/oper || from

   near the bottom of ~oper/.login (or something equivalent if oper
   uses a different shell than tcsh) so that a list of pending
   messages is printed if there is any mail at each login (this line
   will work assuming you choose the more popular "mbox" mail format
   when configuring exim4).  As of this writing Etch does not
   automatically do this (if it does later you may want to remove the
   line you added).  Be sure to handle any messages you see.

3. The two installed disks are set-up as a RAID1 array.  Please read
   /usr2/fs/misc/RAID.txt to familiarize yourself with features of
   this set-up and how to use it operationally.

4. If you want to use the Gnome Desktop for non-FS operations, you can
   create a new user for this, maybe "desktop" with:

     adduser desktop --home /usr2/desktop 

   and answer the prompts. Be sure to give the user a strong password.
   You can test it by logging in with this account on the X-display
   <Ctrl><Alt><F7>.  The Desktop has several useful tools including
   CD/DVD burning software.

5. A special instructions document for your system may contain
   "special" maintenance procedures that you need to perform.  Please
   check for these. See: _____________________.
