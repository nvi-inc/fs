File: /usr2/fs/misc/FSL8_End_User.txt  Version: 1.9  Date: 120424

	     End User Set-up for GSFC Checked-out FS PC

Welcome to your new FS PC!  You have a base FSL8 with the latest FS
installed but not customized.  Please use this document to guide the
set-up of your PC.  The ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF section at end of this
document should be read carefully.  If you have purchased two
identical PCs for added reliability, please refer to APPENDIX B. TWO
COMPUTER ROTATION in RAID.pdf for information on configuring and using
the second PC. In the set-up instructions in that appendix, the
initial check-out has been completed and the systems are ready for
customization according to this document.

  [Although this document is intended for users setting up a new PC,
  this document is also useful for customization by stations that are
  upgrading an existing computer from a previous FS Linux distribution
  to FSL8.  Additional notes and comments for this case are included
  in the steps below enclosed in square brackets '[]' and indented
  like this paragraph.  Please read the complete instructions for each
  step below to check whether there are any special steps (in
  brackets) when upgrading before following the instructions for the
  step.  Please also be sure to read the ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF section
  at end of this document.  If you are upgrading your PC, please
  follow the instructions in the FSL8_Upgrade.txt document before
  using this document.  Place the etc.tgz, usr2.tgz (and operprog.tgz,
  if you made one) files on the /usr2/old_pc/ directory (you maye need
  to create) of your new computer via whatever means is convenient,
  usually _getting_ them using ftp or scp over the network (start the
  operation _from_ the new machine: incoming ftp and ssh are disabled
  by default).  Having these files permanently stored on your new
  system makes the files from the old machine readily available if you
  need them.  It is good idea to make them (and the"old_pc" directory)
  owned by "root" and read-only for user, group, and others.  Make
  sure your computer is connected to the network if you are using one,
  then skip ahead to step 9 below.]

In addition to the computer components, you should have received:

____ Lenny DVDs
____ Lenny CD-1
____ FSL8Install CD, which contains the latest versions of:
     fs8linux_DVD.txt, fs8.selections, fsadapt-*.tgz, fs-*.tgz,
     fs*up.txt, FSL8_PC_Checkout.txt, FSL8_Upgrade.txt,
     FSL8_End_User.txt, RAID.pdf, refresh_secondary.hdc,
     refresh_secondary.sdb, mdstat.7, refresh_spare_usr2, 
     and any special instructions, drivers or other files for
     your system.  The contents of this CD will help you to make
     a complete re-install even if you don't have an Internet
     connection and/or lose the hard copy of these documents.
____ fs8linux_DVD.txt print-out.
____ Special instructions for this system, in document: _______________.
____ Completed Check-out document Checklist, with annotations
____ End User Set-up Checklist, (this document)

The computer components and any extra items specific to this system
should be listed on the Check-out Checklist.

If you need to do a complete re-install, check for any special
instructions for your system (usually named "motherboard.txt", where
"motherboard" is the model of your motherboard).  If you find special
instructions, follow them.  If you don't find special instructions,
follow the instructions in fs8linux_DVD.txt.  The "INSTALLATION" and
"CUSTOMIZATION" sections of FSL8_Upgrade.txt may prove helpful for
some of the associated activities needed for a complete install.

The Set-up Checklist follows:

____ 1. Assemble your PC

____ 2. Make sure the PC is not connected to the network

____ 3. Power it up.

____ 4. Switch to vt1 <Ctrl><Alt><F1>

____ 5. Log in as "root", the system was shipped with a root password
        of "vlbIcdp1".

____ 6. Change the root password using the "passwd" command. Be sure
        to use a strong password.

     7. Create strong passwords for the "oper", "prog", and, if the
        account exists, "desktop" accounts:

        ____  passwd oper
        ____  passwd prog
        ____  passwd desktop
   
____ 8. Switch to the X-display <Ctrl><Alt><F7>. Normally the X-server
        will automatically detect and use the correct configuration
        for your video card and monitor. If you would like to change
        the resolution, you will need to create and hand edit a server
        configuration file. To do this return to vt1 <Ctrl><Alt><F1>
        and run:

         dexconf

        Then edit, the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file and add a Display
        subsection to the "Screen" section, much like the example
        below, but selecting your preferred color depth and modes:

	  Section "Screen"
             Identifier  "Default Screen"
             Monitor     "Configured Monitor"
             SubSection  "Display"
                         Depth       24
                         Modes       "1280x1024" "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
             EndSubSection
           EndSection

        Often "24" is a useful choice for color depth unless you have
        choosen a mode with very high resolution and your video card
        doesn't have enough memory to support it.

        After reconfiguring the X server, switch back to X display
        <Ctrl><Alt><F7> and restart the X server
        <Ctrl><Alt><Backspace>.  If the gdm login comes up
        successfully and after logging in as "prog", the display is
        acceptable, you are done with X set-up.  Please log-out from
        the login shell on the X display.

9. Set-up your printers.

   ____ 9a. Connect your printers to the computer.

              [Existing computers being upgraded may have parallel
              ports and these can continue to be used.]

            Newer computers probably do not have a parallel port (IEEE
            1284).  If not, and your printer requires a parallel
            connection, you should be able to obtain a USB/Parallel
            converter locally for less than US$20.

   ____ 9b. Login in to the X-display <Ctrl><Alt><F7> as "oper".

   ____ 9c. Start firefox by entering:

              firefox

   ____ 9d. Enter URL: http://localhost:631

   ____ 9e. Select "Administration" tab.

   ____ 9f. Add the printers.  

              [If you are upgrading an existing computer you may be
              able to get useful printer configuration information
              from the /etc/printcap file or the files in /etc/cups
              directory on your old computer.  You should either be
              able to examine these files on your old operational disk
              or from the "etc" archive you made from that disk.
              Assuming the archive has been placed on /usr2/old_pc on
              the new computer, you can extract the files for
              examination in the /tmp directory using the commands:

                cd /tmp
                tar xzf /usr2/old_pc/etc.tgz etc/printcap

              or

                cd /tmp
                tar xzf /usr2/old_pc/etc.tgz etc/cups
              ]

            Connected printers may be automatically offered to be
            added.  You may also be able to find printers using the
            "Find Printer" function. You will need to supply the root
            account and password for validation as part of the printer
            management process.  If CUPS offers you the wrong type of
            printer to be automatically added or it is unclear what
            driver to select for a printer, you may be able to get
            some useful information to help with manually installing
            your printer by searching the WWW for the string "cups"
            and your printer model.

            Be sure to select a printer as the default.

   ____ 9g. Quit firefox.

   ____ 9h. Log-out as "oper".

   ____ 9i. If you want simpler device names than the CUPS system uses
            for automatically configured printers, then on vt1
            <Ctrl><Alt><F1> as "root" edit the file
            /etc/cups/printers.conf and change the "..."  (name) in
            the <Printer ...> lines and in the ppd/ sub-directory
            rename the corresponding files, then:

              invoke-rc.d cups restart         

____ 10. Return to vt1 <Ctrl><Alt><F1>. Change directory to the
         fsadapt sub-directory:

           cd /root/fsadapt

____ 11. Set your network parameters,

           [Existing computers being upgraded from previous versions
           of FS Linux should already have their network parameters
           defined and so can skip this step.]

          Run the "netconfig" script and answer the questions:

            ./netconfig

           In the "/etc/hesiod.conf", you should update the "rhs="
           line to reflect your domain.

____ 12. Reboot.

____ 13. Generate ssh system keys.

           [Existing systems being upgraded from previous versions of
           FS Linux can either use the new keys already generating in
           the update process or delete those keys and transfer the
           keys from the old system to maintain compatibility with
           other systems expecting the same keys.  You can use the
           "etc.tgz" archive, created as part of the upgrade process,
           as described in step 13B below.  If you will use the keys
           already generated, skip to step (14).  If you want to use
           old keys, then before installing them according to 13B
           below, delete the already generated keys, as "root":

             cd /etc/ssh
             rm *key *key.pub
           
           Note an upgraded system will normally already have a
           running network connection at this point.]

         You have two choices here, either (A) generate new keys or
         (B) use existing keys from a previous system that is being
         replaced or upgraded.

         (A) To generate new keys, as "root":

               dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

         (B) To install old key from a system being replaced or
             upgraded, first make an archive of the /etc directory on
             the old computer and copy it to this computer (if you
             haven't already), as "root":

               cd /
               tar czf /tmp/etc.tgz etc

             If the archive is too large to place on your old
             computer's /tmp directory, you can place it somewhere
             else where there is more room, perhaps /usr2.  Then copy
             the archive to the /usr2/old_pc directory of the new
             computer and execute these commands as "root":

               cd /tmp
               tar xzf /usr2/old_pc/etc.tgz etc/ssh
               cd /tmp/etc/ssh
               cp -a *key *key.pub /etc/ssh
               invoke-rc.d ssh restart         

             If the method you want to use to copy the archive to
             /usr2/old_pc is the over the network (a CD, DVD, or USB
             drive would work instead) and you do not already have a
             running network connection (i.e. this is new system), you
             will need to wait until after you have rebooted in step
             15 below to make the transfer.  If that is the case, you
             should generate temporary keys according to step 12A and
             then after step (15) below, execute as "root":

               cd /etc/ssh
               rm *key *key.pub

             to delete the temporary keys before using the
             instructions above in this step (12B) to copy the old
             keys from the archive.

____ 14. Set hosts.deny and hosts.allow.

         [Systems being upgraded will not already have the shown
         contents of hosts.deny.  For upgraded systems, the file
         should be modified to agree with these contents.]

         These files define how TCP wrappers control access to the
         machine over the network.  As delivered, this is set as
         restrictively as possible with /etc/hosts.allow only
         containing comments and /etc/hosts.deny set to:

ALL: PARANOID
#
ALL: ALL

         You may wish to allow incoming connections in
         /etc/hosts.allow.  The syntax of "hosts.deny" and
         "hosts.allow" is documented in "man 5 hosts_access".  We
         recommend that your changes are only to add:

sshd: node

         lines to hosts.allow for specific hosts.  This will allow
         selective incoming ssh access.

____ 15. If the machine resides on a network with NTP available,
         please configure NTP.  If need be, this step can be deferred
         until a convenient time.

         You should use a set of up to 10 NTP servers, some local and
         some remote.  At least one should be local if possible, but
         having a few is better.  A few should be remote if possible.
         The idea is to give NTP a population of servers to analyze in
         order to pick the best one.  Local servers, besides having a
         shorter round-trip communication delay are available if the
         connection to the wider network should fail. The remote
         servers, when available, normally provide a reality check on
         the local servers, but in some cases may be better.  A TAC
         running TAC32+ with the NTP server function enabled is
         suitable as a local server.  If you do not already have a
         list of NTP servers to use, you may be able to get
         suggestions from:

           http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Servers/WebHome.

           [If you are upgrading from a previous version of FS Linux
           you can recover the NTP servers from the old system.  To
           list the previous NTP servers, extract the NTP
           configuration file from the "etc" archive made during the
           upgrade process, assume the archive is on /usr2/old_pc,
           execute these commands as "root":

             cd /tmp
             tar xzf /usr2/old_pc/etc.tgz etc/ntp.conf
             grep ^server ntp.conf

           Then continue with rest of the instructions in this step.]

         Once you determine a list of servers, you should put them in
         /etc/ntp.conf on "server" lines, in place of the default
         "server" lines. You will also need to add a "restrict" line
         with the "kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery" qualification
         for each server, for example (white space added for clarity):

server   timehost.gsfc.nasa.gov
restrict timehost.gsfc.nasa.gov kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   godz.gsfc.nasa.gov
restrict godz.gsfc.nasa.gov     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   tacggao.gsfc.nasa.gov
restrict tacggao.gsfc.nasa.gov  kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   ntp2.usno.navy.mil
restrict ntp2.usno.navy.mil     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   navobs1.gatech.edu
restrict navobs1.gatech.edu     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery
server   tick.usno.navy.mil
restrict tick.usno.navy.mil     kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery

         These changes will take effect the next time the system is
         booted or you can use:

           invoke-rc.d ntp restart         
 
         If you sometimes suffer loss of connection to your domain
         name servers, typically because they are off site, you should
         use IP addresses of the servers instead of their node names.

____ 16. Update the emacs configuration:

           dpkg-reconfigure emacs22

____ 17. Connect the machine to the network and reboot.

           [If you are upgrading an existing computer, this step is
           probably not needed since it is probably already connected
           to and accessing the network.]

____ 18. Customize the FS for your station.  If this computer is
         replacing a computer where the FS is already set-up for your
         station or you are upgrading to FSL8, please follow the steps
         in this section.  If the computer is for a new installation,
         please skip to the step 19.

         For a replacement computer or FSL8 upgrade, please take the
         following steps:

           [If you are upgrading your existing computer, please skip
           step 18a.  These archives were already made as part of the
           upgrade process.]

    ____ 18a. On your old computer, make a back-up of your station
              software as "root":

                cd /usr2
                tar czf /tmp/usr2.tgz control log proc sched st-* st

              If you have a lot of customization in oper and prog
              directories, you can copy them by making another
              archive.  You can use, as "root":

                tar czf /tmp/operprog.tgz oper prog

              Please note that if the archive files are too large to
              fit on /tmp, you can make them somewhere else where is
              more space, possibly /usr2, and/or you may need to only
              archive only a subset of the contents of the
              directories.

    ____ 18b. If they aren't already there, place the etc.tgz,
              usr2.tgz (and operprog.tgz, if you made one) files in
              the /usr2/old_pc/ directory (you may need to create it)
              of your new computer via whatever means is convenient,
              usually _getting_ them using ftp or scp over the network
              (start the operation _from_ the new machine: incoming
              ftp and ssh are disabled by default).  Having these
              files permanently stored on your new system makes the
              files from the old machine readily available if you need
              them.  It is good idea to make them (and the"old_pc"
              directory) owned by "root" and read-only for user,
              group, and others.

    ____ 18c. As a first attempt at customizing the "oper" and "prog"
              home directories, the easiest choice will probably be to
              start using the default files on the new system and
              customize them by hand as you find changes that were on
              your old computer that are needed on the new computer.
              Alternatively, you can systematically compare the old
              files and the new files, copying and nerging files as
              needed.  If you made an operprog.tgz on the old PC, you
              will probably find it useful when making these changes,
              you can expand the archive into /tmp using
 
                cd /tmp
                tar xzpf /usr2/old_pc/operprog.tgz

              You can use the "diff" command to compare the new
              default files to your old versions to get an idea of how
              to merge the two versions.  Typically the "oper" and
              "prog" versions of the ".fvwm2rc" and ".Xresources" file
              are the most important files to recover.

    ____ 18d. You will need to make your control files, SNAP
              procedures, and station software agree with the version
              of the FS on your new computer.  There are three
              possible cases: (1) the FS version on the new computer
              is older than the one on our old computer, (2) the FS
              version on the new computer is same as the one on our
              old computer, and (3) the FS version on the new computer
              is newer than the one on our old computer.  Follow the
              appropriate instructions below for your case:

             (1) If the FS version on the new computer is older than
                 the one on our old computer, you should install the
                 source from the latest version as described in that
                 version's update notice, then proceed with option (2)
                 or (3) below as appropriate.

             (2) If the FS version on the new computer is same as the
                 one on our old computer, relatively little needs to
                 be done.

                 Login in as "prog" and compile your local software:

                   cd /usr2/st
                   make rmdoto rmexe all

                 The new C compiler is stricter about some things and
                 may require you to make some changes to your source
                 code in order for it to compile.  Warnings, as
                 opposed to actual errors, can probably be ignored for
                 now, but should be dealt with eventually.  Typically
                 they are related to missing '#include' files and can
                 lead to subtle (new or old) bugs, so should not be
                 ignored for very long.  They are usually easy to fix.

             (3) If the FS version on the new computer is newer than
                 the one on our old computer, you should update your
                 control files and SNAP procedures on the new computer
                 as described in the update notice in
                 /usr2/fs/misc. The update notice file name is of the
                 form: "fs*up.txt".  You should use the most recent
                 update notice, which should correspond to the FS
                 version installed.  Please also see the comment about
                 the stricter compilers in case (2) above.

         18e. The system items that may have changed as part of moving
              to the new computer are:

         ____ (1) The serial port devices. On the new system these
                  are /dev/ttyS4 through /dev/ttyS11. You may need to
                  adjust your dev.ctl control file depending on which
                  serial ports you use for which devices.

         ____ (2) The PCI-GPIB board name on the new system is
                  "gpib0". You may need to adjust the GPIB entry in
                  the dev.ctl control file to reflect this.

         ____ (3) New print2dymo script.  Please follow the
                  instructions in /usr2/fs/st.default/skedf.ctl to
                  set-up a new print2dymo on your new computer, using
                  your computer's Dymo printer name in place of "Dymo"
                  in "lpr -P Dymo".  Please note the syntax of the
                  "-P" parameter may be different for FSL8 than what
                  you used before, i.e. needs a space after the "P".
                  If there are no lines to use in the script that are
                  indicated for FSL8, please use the lines for
                  FSL7. They also work for FLS8.

    ____ 18f. Any station software you have that runs outside of the
              FS, including daemons that are started at boot time,
              such as tacdclient, metserver, and metclient will need
              to be set-up.  Please refer to the corresponding
              documentation on how to do this.  The documentation and
              default source for tacdclient, metserver, and metclient
              is included the corresponding sub-directories of
              /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0.  FS version 9.10.3 (and
              later) included modifications to the default source code
              to support use with FSL7 and should work with FSL8 as
              well.  You should compare the new source to your old
              source to see what needs to be changed.

    ____ 18g. Reboot your system.

    ____ 18h. Test the FS to verify that it works, including printing
              labels and schedule listings and running part of a
              schedule as a test.  You should pay special attention to
              whether all GPIB devices work since the FSL8 driver may
              have problems with some older devices. If you have some
              GPIB device that the new driver cannot communicate with,
              please contact Ed (Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov); you may want to
              consider getting a National Instruments 779732-x to
              allow all your GPIB devices to be supported.

    ____ 18i. Set-up the time.ctl file. Please see the SETUP section
              of /usr2/fs/misc/fstime.txt for instructions on how to
              do this.

         After completing this section, jump ahead to step 20.

____ 19. New station set-up. A new station set-up will require
         customizing the control files in /usr2/control, particularly:
         antenna.ctl, location.ctl, dev.ctl, ibad.ctl, and mk5ad.ctl.
         You will need to select the correct version of station.prc to
         copy to /usr2/proc.  You can find a table of the different
         versions of station.prc in the introductory remarks of the
         latest FS upgrade notice, for example
         "/usr2/fs/miscfs9104up.txt".  If you have a Mark III, Mark IV
         or VLBA formatter, or a S2 DAS or recorder, or a Mark5B
         recorder, you should set-up the time.ctl control file.
         Please see the SETUP section of /usr2/fs/misc/fstime.txt for
         instructions on how to do this.

         It is not necessary now, but in the long run it is desirable
         to develop a station specific "antcn" program.  This can be
         done by modifying the code in /usr2/st/antcn to suit your
         antenna.  Keeping your "antcn" program (and any other local
         software) in the "/usr2/st" directory tree instead of the
         "/usr2/fs" tree will make FS upgrades much easier to install
         and no functionality will be lost.  More information is
         available from Ed (Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov) on both customizing
         the control files and developing an "antcn".

____ 20. Configure e-mail.

           [If you are upgrading a computer with a previous version of
           FS Linux, the contents of the old exim configuration may
           help you to customize the new version.  To extract the exim
           configuration file from the "etc" archive made during the
           upgrade process, assuming the archive is on /usr2/old_pc,
           execute these commands as "root":

              cd /tmp
              tar xzf /usr2/old_pc/etc.tgz etc/exim/exim.conf

           or if you are upgrading from FSL7, extract the entire
           /etc/exim4 directory:

              cd /tmp
              tar xzf /usr2/old_pc/etc.tgz etc/exim4

           ]

         As "root", enter:

           dpkg-reconfigure exim4-config

         to change the set-up. Typically you should select "internet
         site" and defaults for all the other prompts.  (The only
         other recommended choices are "local delivery only" or "mail
         sent by smarthost; received via SMTP or fetchmail") If you
         want to receive incoming mail, you will also need to enable
         SMTP connections in Window 4a of fsadapt.  We recommend that
         you not receive incoming mail on this computer.

         If you follow the recommendation not to receive incoming
         mail, you should set the "reply-to" address for outgoing
         messages to a real e-mail account at your institution that is
         read regularly.  You can do this by (all as "root"):

           (1) Create a file /etc/exim4/reply-to-filter with contents
               (four lines from between the dashed lines):

---------------------------------------------
# Exim filter          << THIS LINE REQUIRED

headers remove "Reply-To"
headers add "Reply-To: email@address"
--------------------------------------------

               Where "email@address" is the e-mail address you want
               replies to be addressed to.


           (2) In /etc/exim4/exim4.conf.template, at the beginning of
               the fill add (two lines from between the dashed lines):

--------------------------------------------
#set reply to
system_filter = /etc/exim4/reply-to-filter
--------------------------------------------

           (3) Then execute

               /etc/init.d/exim4 restart

         If you have made the above changes to direct replies to
         another e-mail account, you should customize the User Name
         (not login name, the User Name is the fifth field) of "root",
         "prog", and "oper" in "/etc/passwd" to identify the source of
         the message. For "root" and "prog", it is recommended to
         append a string like "at node.domain", where node.domain is
         this machine, e.g., for "atri.gsfc.nasa.gov" you might change
         the 5th field for "root" from

           root

         to

           root at atri.gsfc.nasa.gov

         For "oper", you might instead prepend your site name to the
         accounts for clearer reading in "ops" e-mail messages, e.g.,
         for "oper" on "atri" at GSFC, we changed the 5th field for
         "oper" to:

           GSFC VLBI Operator

         and for completeness, for "prog" use:

           GSFC VLBI Programmer

         These changes will help the recipient (possibly you)
         determine which system generated this message since it may
         not be obvious given the modified return address.

         The configuration described here ("Internet site" in the
         exim4 configuration, no incoming mail, reply-to-filter,
         and modified user names), provides good support of the FS
         "msg" utility.

         If you use the recommended configuration, your /etc/alias
         file is set-up to forward all mail to "oper".  This is
         recommended as a "catch all" since the "oper" account is
         presumably under regular use and any messages sent there are
         more likely to be noticed. This is particularly important for
         system error messages since they should be delivered to a
         mail box on the system in case there is a network problem
         that might prevent them from being delivered off system.  You
         can however add additional off machine delivery of these
         messages to whatever addressees you wish and we recommend
         this as well.  These should include an e-mail account at your
         institution that is read regularly (maybe the same address as
         the "Reply-To" address you may have set above would be a good
         choice).  To do this, create a ".forward" file on "oper"s
         home directory. The contents should be similar to (left
         justfied):

           \oper
           user@node.domain

         where "user@node,domain" is the off machine addressee you
         want the messages to go to.  You can add additional lines for
         additional addressees. The backslash ("\") before "oper"
         prevents the mail system from getting into an infinite loop
         re-checking "oper"s .forward file.

         Lastly, check the default mailbox /var/mail/mail for any
         messages that may have arrived before the e-mail system was
         configured. Be sure to resolve any system messages that may
         have been received:

           mail -f /var/mail/mail

____ 21. Weekly updates. If your computer is connected to the
         Internet, you should enable weekly security updates in Window
         2 of fsadapt (all steps in the section must be done as
         "root"):

           cd /root/fsadapt
           ./fsadapt

         Hit return on the first screen and "skip" on "Window 1" then
         "OK", then set _only_ "updates" on "Window 2", then "OK",
         then "Cancel" on "Window 3".

         It is possible to set-up the weekly update script to
         automatically install the updates instead of just downloading
         them by making changes to the script.  However, in order to
         avoid unexpected changes in your system, particularly during
         experiments, this is not recommend.  The weekly check for
         updates can be turned off by deleting the script file
         /etc/cron.weekly/apt-get.  If later you wish to re-install
         it, please follow the directions above.

           [If you are upgrading an existing computer, you may have
           already performed the next action, configured
           sources.lists, as part of the upgrade process.]

         You should edit the /etc/apt/sources.list file and move the
         "deb http..." and deb-src http..." lines before "deb
         cdrom..." lines.  This will save you from possibly having to
         insert DVDs (or CDs), if you ever want to install a new
         package.  You can change the line with "ftp.us.debian.org" to
         use any convenient local mirror, which should improve speed
         compared to the default.  The line with "security.debian.org"
         must not be changed.

         Make a manual check for any updates currently needed:

           apt-get update
           /etc/cron.weekly/apt-get

         If any updates are needed, instructions are displayed, follow
         them.  This usually means entering:

           apt-get -uy upgrade
           apt-get clean

         For some motherboards it may be necessary to re-install
         special drivers after an "upgrade", please see any special
         documentation that came with your system.  If the PC was
         checked out at GSFC, the document (if it exists) is
         identified at the end of the printed out version of this
         document supplied with the PC, in the ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF
         section.

         After the updates have been enabled, the Debian security
         archive will be automatically checked weekly for needed
         updates.  If there are any security updates that need to be
         applied, an e-mail will be sent to "root", usually forwarded
         to "oper".  The account receiving these e-mails should be
         checked weekly.  The e-mail contains instructions on how to
         install the updates.  See the previous step (20) on enabling
         e-mail for more useful details on this.

         As long as the machine will be continuous operation, and this
         is the assumption for FS computers, even spare computers,
         since this is needed to keep them healthy, we recommend that
         you remove the "anacron" package. Doing so will ensure that
         the apt-get script is running at time that is likely to not
         be busy, typicall 0647 UT Sunday morning. To remove
         "anacron", enter the command (as "root"):

            aptitude purge anacron

         answer the prompt to continue affirmatively.

ISSUES TO BE AWARE OF

This section covers some issue you should be aware of when dealing
with your FSL8 system.

1. If your system is connected to the Internet, it is imperative that
   you enable weekly updates, as described above, check the e-mail
   account that the messages about updates are sent to, and apply the
   updates in a timely fashion.  Once the Linux distribution is no
   longer current, new security updates should continue to be
   available for another year.  Before that year expires, you should
   develop a plan and implement it to transition to the new current
   version *or* remove the machine from the network.

2. By default, all incoming e-mail is local only.  All "root" and
   "prog" e-mail is sent to "oper".  It is important that "oper" check
   e-mail regularly, at least weekly, for important system messages.
   There are two types of messages you will normally receive: (i)
   messages about patches that need to be applied and (ii) messages
   about degraded RAID arrays when you do a disk rotation.  If you get
   a message you do not know how to handle, please contact Ed
   (Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov).  It is also important that e-mail to this
   account is NOT forwarded to another machine so that if a problem
   develops with the network, it will still be possible to get
   e-mailed error messages.  Please be sure there is a line:

     test ! -f /var/mail/oper || from

   near the bottom of ~oper/.login (or something equivalent if oper
   uses a different shell than tcsh) so that a list of pending
   messages is printed if there is any mail at each login (this line
   will work assuming you choose the more popular "mbox" mail format
   when configuring exim4).  As of this writing Lenny does not
   automatically check for user mail at login (if it does later you
   may want to remove the line you added).  Be sure to handle any
   messages you see.  They will be about issues that require your
   attention.

3. The two installed disks are set-up as a RAID1 array.  Please read
   /usr2/fs/misc/RAID.pdf to familiarize yourself with features of
   this set-up and how to use it operationally.

4. If you have a new PC checked out by GSFC or you installed on new PC
   or upgraded an old one and you installed the Desktop Environment,
   there should be a user "desktop" that was created during the
   installation process.  You can use this account to access the tools
   on the X-display <Ctrl><Alt><F7>.  The Desktop has several useful
   tools including CD/DVD burning software.

5. A special instructions document for your system may contain
   "special" maintenance procedures that you need to perform.  Please
   check for these. See: _____________________.
