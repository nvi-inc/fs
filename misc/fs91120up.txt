		       FS 9.11.20 Update Notice


I. Introduction

This document is divided into four sections:

  I.   Introduction
  II.  Installation
  III. Changes Since Version 9.11.19
  A.   Reference Appendix for Installation

This update is intended for all stations.  In addition to several
small improvements, the main change in this version is support in
'drudg' for 'sched' staggered start mode which schedules different
recording start times at different stations.  This cannot work
optimally because it does not follow the 'sked' observation time-line
that 'drudg' assumes.  However, the new support will reduce wasted
recording time, improve the quality of the Tsys measurements, and
maximize the time that the data is marked valid after the Tsys
measurements.

We encourage all stations to upgrade now even if they do not need the
new features and bugs fixes because doing so will make future upgrades
easier.  Upgrading from 9.11.19 is very easy.

The most significant changes in version 9.11.20 were:

   (i) Ad hoc support in 'drudg' for 'sched' stagger start mode.  In
       this mode there are different recording start times at
       different stations.  The data valid time for a station is the
       time that the antenna is expected to reach the source at that
       station.  This violates the 'sked' observation timeline that
       'drudg' assumes.  However, with advice from Jon Quick
       (HartRAO), we have tried to make the best possible work around
       that will support this mode.  In this case, 'drudg' will start
       recording at the indicated data valid time, then execute
       'preob', then mark the data valid, then run 'midob'.  This
       minimizes the wasted recording time and maximizes the chances
       that a good calibration will be possible when 'preob' is run.
       It also maximizes the amount of time the data is marked valid
       after 'preob' completes because there are no time sequencing
       commands in the schedule between the start of recording through
       'midob'.  This accomodates continuous or non-continuous
       calibration 'preob' procedures automatically.
 
  (ii) Improvements to 'mk5c_mode' to fully support Mark 5C and
       FlexBuff recording for both 5B/Ethernet and VDIF recording with
       jive5ab.  This change consists primarily of accepting any
       effective sample rate and total bit rate that will fit in an
       unsigned 64-bit integer, i.e., 18446744073709551615 Hz or Mbps.
       Rates that do not correpond to integer Hz sample rates and
       integer MHz total bit rates are not supported.  This has no
       impact on current usage of the 'mk5c_mode' command and goes
       significantly beyond any capability that is needed now.  This
       change cleaned up several internal aspects of the
       implementation, including using only integer arithmetic for the
       rates, and provides complete compatibilty with jive5ab in this
       area.  Thanks to Harro Verkoutor (JIVE) for motivation, help
       with implementation details, and help with testing this change.

       As part of this change, the 'bit_streams=...' command now
       ignores all parameters except the bit mask.

       Please see 'help=mk5c_mode' for more details.  This help page
       also includes a description of how to enable 5B/Ethernet
       recording, which the FS does not directly support, in case it
       is needed in an unusual situation.

 (iii) The FMST program for Mark 5B recorders was improved to give a
       specific error message for the case where it is run right after
       the jive5ab control program is started.  In this case, jive5ab
       reports an error rather than reporting the time, since there
       has been no 'dot_set=...' command (DIMino does not report an
       error in this case).  Although FMSET already reported an error
       and still allowed the time to be set, it seemed worthwhile to
       have a more specific message in this case.  This should also
       help ease the transition for stations that are moving from
       DIMino to jive5ab.

  (iv) Several small improvements were made to plog and fesh.

   (v) The VEX parser now support units for the rate in clock_early
       statements.

  (vi) Improved example versions of the station 'metserver' and
       'metclient' programs.  The improvements include trapping more
       error and support for WMT70x wind sensors.  The FS now supports
       acces to local or remote instances of 'metserver'.

 (vii) Small improvements were made to gnplt: more Tcal points pre
       band and non-default font sizes.

(viii) Support for user devices in 'tsys', 'onoff', and 'fivept'
       commands that don't support measurements of zero level.

As always, we are deeply indebted to Jonathan Quick (HartRAO) for his
many significant contributions that go far beyond what is explicitly
mentioned.


II. Installation

Detailed instructions are provided below for installing 9.11.20 as an
upgrade to 9.11.19, the previous stable release.  If you have an older
version than 9.11.17, please refer to the appendix, which is described
next, for more information.

A section 'A. Reference Appendix for Installation' is provided at the
end of this document.  It includes seven sub-sections:

 A.1. Upgrading from FS versions before the previous stable
 A.2. Example standard procedure libraries
 A.3. Cut-and-paste installation tips
 A.4. Making a back-up before installing
 A.5. Disk space requirements
 A.6. Set operations file permissions
 A.7.  Fix .prc file 'define' lines

If you haven't upgraded or installed the FS before, you may want to
review the appendix.  It is STRONGLY recommended that you back-up your
operational system before upgrading.

The installation steps for upgrading from 9.11.19 are listed below.

 (0) Back-up your operational system.  Having a back-up to return to
     will allow you to continue operations in case something goes
     wrong with the installation.  For more detail, please see
     sub-section 'A.4. Making a back-up before installing'.

 (1) Place a copy of the fs-9.11.20 archive in your FS machine's
     '/tmp' directory.  For example, you might do the following:

       a. navigate to URL https://vlbi.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/fs
       b. enter your FS account name and password at the prompt
       c. click on the 'dist' link
       d. download fs-9.11.20.tgz
       e. scp transfer fs-9.11.20.tgz to your FS machine, placing it
          in '/tmp' directory

     Another FS server is available at: http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/.

     Your institution must have an account on the servers in order to
     download files.  Please contact Ed (ed.himwich@nasa.gov), if you
     need an account or can't find your password.

 (2) Log-in as 'root'.

 (3) Extract the source from the archive:

       cd /
       tar xzpf /tmp/fs-9.11.20.tgz

 (4) Set the link for the new FS version:

       cd /usr2
       ln -sfn fs-9.11.20 fs

 (5) Having the wrong ownership and/or permissions on the operational
     files can cause errors during FS operations.  If this needs to be
     fixed, please refer to sub-section: 'A.6. Set operations file
     permissions' to make sure they are all set to the correct
     values.

 (6) ** VERY IMPORTANT **  Log-out as 'root', and log-in as 'prog'.

 (7) Make the FS:

       cd /usr2/fs
       make 

 (8) This step is for modifying your local programs. That should not
     be necesary for this update, but we do recommend that recompile
     and relink your programs against the new FS version as described
     in the next step.

     However, if you use 'metserver' and/or 'metclient', we recommend
     that you update yout local copies with the new versions.  You can
     defer this until the FS itself has been updated successfully.
     The new FS will work with the old version of 'metserver' if you
     update your 'equip.ctl' as described in step (12) below.

 (9) Remake your local software.  If '/usr2/st/Makefile' is set-up in
     the standard way, you can do this with:

       cd /usr2/st   
       make rmdoto rmexe all

(10) ** VERY IMPORTANT **

     Reboot the computer.  This is important for re-initializing
     shared memory with the new version.

     ** VERY IMPORTANT **

(11) Log-in as 'oper'.
     
(12) This step is for updates to the local control files.  The only
     change in the control files is in 'equip.ctl'.  An update is only
     required if you use the 'metserver' program for meteorological
     data in the FS.  However, even if you don't use it, it is
     recommended that you update the comments so there won't be
     confusion in the future.

     The change is in the line for met. sensor type (non-comment line
     16).  Previously for use with 'metserver' only a number port
     number was supplied on this line.  In the new version the port
     number must be followed by a hostname. The nominal values for
     these parameters are:

       50001 localhost

     However, other port numbers can be used and other hosts depending
     on how 'metserver' is configured.  The hostname may be up to 64
     characters in length.  The change to the comments, which all
     stations should implement, before this non-comment line, are:

       *met sensor type: cdp or two fields for metserver: port hostname 
       *default choice for metserver is  50001 localhost      

     Please see '/usr2/fs/st.default/control/equip.ctl' for an
     example.

(13) This step is for updates to your SNAP procedure files.  There are
     two changes.  The first (i) is required if you use a Mark 5
     recorder.  The second (ii) is optional and only needed if you
     want the 'sched_end' procedure to push experiment logs for you.

      i.  If you use a Mark 5 recorder, the previous standard was to
          record the bank in use in the 'midob' procedure.  It is now
          recognized that this may fail.  Instead the set-up procedure
          generated by 'drudg' includes:

            mk5=bank_set?

          command after the 'bank_check' commmand if (and only if) a
          Mark 5 recorder is in use.

          Previous instructions sent on the FS mail list recommended
          that the above command be removed from 'midob' and for
          stations using Mark 5 recorders only, to place it in the
          'checkmk5' procedure.  For stations that switch between Mark
          5 and FLeBuff, it was recommended that they manage it as
          they wished, but if the above command was used with
          FlexBuff, it would fail.

          Accordingly, please review your 'midob' and 'checkmk5'
          procedures in any versions of your station procedure library
          that you maintain and remove any instances of the above
          command.  

     ii.  If you wish you can update your 'sched_end' procedures to
          auotmatically push logs as described below in the FS changes
          section under item 12.  Please refer to that item for a
          description of the changes.

(14) This step is for miscellaneous FS related changes.  There are
     two.  One (i) is recommended if you have been using 'plog'.  The
     other (ii) is optional, to be used if you want a non-default size
     font in 'gnplt'

      i.  If you have been using 'plog' to push logs, it is
          recommended that you clean-up any existing cookie files.
          You can find them using:

            find /usr2 -name '.urs_cookies'

          They can be deleted individually using the login of the
          account that owns them, typically 'oper'.

     ii.  If you want to use a font size other than the default (8) in
          'gnplt', you set an enviroment variable in your shell
          session before running 'gnplt'.  A possible larger more
          readable font size might be '12'.  If your shell is 'tcsh',
          you can use '12' issuing the following command before
          running 'gnplt' by issuing:

            setenv FS_GNPLT_FONTSIZE 12

          for 'bash', use:

            export FS_GNPLT_FONTIZE=12

          To make this the default whenever you login, you can add the
          appropriate command to your '~/.loginrc' ('tcsh') or
          '~/.profile' ('bash') file as appropriate.

(15) Test the FS as 'oper'.  Generally speaking a fairly thorough test
     is to run a test experiment.  Start with using 'drudg' to rotate
     a schedule, 'drudg'-ing it to make '.snp' and '.prc' files,
     making listings, and any other pre-experiment preparation you
     normally do, then execute part of schedule, and perform any
     normal post-experiment plotting and clean-up that you do.  The
     idea here is to verify that everything works as you expect for
     normal operations.  In particular for this upgrade you should
     test that Mark 5 operations work as expected.

(16) This step is for miscellaneous FSLx changes. None are required
     for this update.

(17) Consider when to update your back-ups.  You certainly should not
     update them until you have performed the tests described above.
     It would be prudent to wait until you have successfully run an
     experiment or two and preferably received word that the
     experiment(s) produced good data.  The chances of needing to use
     your back-up should be small.  If something does happen, you can
     copy the back-up to the (now assumed bad) updated disk.  You can
     then either use the restored disk or apply the FS update again.
     Managing this is a lot safer if you have a third disk.


III. Changes Since Version 9.11.19

This section is divided into three sub-sections: A. Changes in the FS,
B. Changes in 'drudg', and C. Known FS Bugs.  Each sub-section starts
with a summary of the items covered followed by a more detailed
description.

    conditions.
10. The DBBC PFB 'form=...' command now accepts codes 'spol', 'full'
    and 'full_auto'.
11. Recovery of log files that were deleted while the FS was still
    writing to them was made faster.
12. The 'if' command can now test on the schedule name, including
    just leading substrings.
13. Improved versions of station 'metserver' and metclient' programs
    are included.
14. The 'mk5b_mode' command now uses "updsnor" for 'net_protocol' in
    all cases for FlexBuff.
15. The maximum size of the Tcal table as a function of frequency was
    increased to 1200.
16. Added environment variable 'FS_GNPLT_FONTSIZE' to select
    non-default font sizes.
17. Support for user devices in 'tsys', 'onoff', and 'fivept' commands
    that don't support measurements of zero level.
18. New 'release' string for version number.
19. Optional Makefile enviroment variable FS_MONIT_ADD_LIB for monit
    family of programs

A more detailed discussion of these changes follows.

 1. Full support of jive5ab sample/bit-rate capabilities for Mark 5C
    and FlexBuff.  This change consists primarily of supporting any
    effective sample rate and total bit rate that will fit in an
    unsigned 64-bit integer, i.e., 18446744073709551615 Hz or Mbps.
    Rates that do not correpond to integer Hz sample rates and integer
    MHz total bit rates are not supported.  This has no impact on
    current usage of the 'mk5c_mode' command and goes significantly
    beyond any capability that is needed now.  This change cleaned
    up several internal aspects of the implementation, including
    using only integer arithmetic for the rates, and provides complete
    compatibilty with jive5ab in this area.  Thanks to Harro Verkouter
    (JIVE) for instigating this improvement and his support in the
    implementationn and testing.

    Ask part of this change, the 'bit_streams=...' command now ignores
    all parameters except the bit mask.

    Please see 'help=mk5c_mode' for more details.  This help page also
    includes a description of how to enable 5B/Ethernet recording,
    which the FS does not directly support, in case it is needed in an
    unusual situation.

 2. FMSET program improved for use with jive5ab on Mark 5B recorders.
    FMSET now gives a specific error message for the case where it is
    run right after the jive5ab control program is started.  In this
    case, jive5ab reports an error rather than reporting the time,
    since there has been no 'dot_set=...' command (DIMino does not
    report an error in this case).  Although FMSET already reported an
    error and still allowed the time to be set, it seemed worthwhile
    to have a more specific message in this case.  This should also
    help ease the transition for stations that are moving from DIMino
    to jive5ab.

 3. Improvements to plog. Plog now checks if a log file is open by
    another program before moving it.  Before this checked was added,
    there could be a bad interaction when a log was still open in
    the Field System and log reduction was to be performed by plog

    Plog now checks for the STATION environment variable only when
    needed.  This improves the utility of plog on non-FS machines.

    Plog now supports OPAR's HTTP method.  The password must be
    requested from the data center and placed in '~/.netrc'.  The old
    OPAR FTP method has been removed.

    Bug fixed for plog's quiet (-q) flag not suppressing certain
    messages.  In particular, progress bars now honour this flag.
    Note that progress bars are not shown if the output is not a
    terminal, for example when plog is opened with popen.

    Bug fix for cookie files being written to the current directory
    rather than the users home.  Cookies are also now created with a
    umask of 007.  Stations may like to look for the extraneous cookie
    files to remove on the file system with, for example, `find /usr2
    -name '.urs_cookies'`.

    Plog now has a version flag to aid debugging.

 4. Improvements in fesh. Fesh's quiet flag now behaves as expected.
    
    Fesh now has a version flag to aid debugging.

 5. logpl now plots values that proceed a trailing semi-colon.  This
    situation might occur in log entries for a low-level VSI-S device
    response.  Thanks to Pablo de Vicente and Javier González García
    at Yebes for contributing this improvement.

 6. An internal error that could cause very long log entries to
    overwrite buffer limits was fixed.  The maximum length of log
    messages (and class messags in general) is 1024 bytes, including
    the time tags.  Longer entries are truncated.

 7. The VEX parser was fixed to work on 64-bit system.

 8. The VEX parser now supports optional units for the clock rate
    field in the clock_early parameter.  Technically, units should be
    required, but for backward compatibility with existing usage they
    are optional.

 9. MATCN was fixed to report some previously ignored error
    conditions.

10. The DBBC PFB 'form=...' command now accepts codes 'spol', 'full'
    and 'full_auto'.  Although the FS does not provide full support
    for operations with these codes, this change should eliminate
    error messages for 'off-label' use of the FS with these codes.

11. Recovery of log files that were deleted while the FS was still
    writing to them was made faster.  Additionally, the formating of
    the progress meter messages was improved to make it clearer that
    the user should wait for this recovery process to finish before
    proceeding.  The latter may help particularly if there is other
    information being output to the display in parallel.

12. The 'if' command can now test on the schedule name, including just
    leading substrings.  A 'schedule:string' condition was added to
    the 'if' command.  The 'string' can either be the entire schedule
    name or a leading substring.  This can be used to make conditional
    commands that depend on the schedule name or a leading substring
    of the name.  Please see 'help=if' for more details. 

    As an example of how this might be used, consider a station that
    participates in both IVS and EVN experiments.  They might want to
    use this feature to set-up have the 'sched_end' procedure to
    automatically and selectively push logs from IVS experiments to
    their selected IVS data center using 'plog'.  The following
    example procedures show how this might be set-up.

    The 'sched_end' procedure could contain:
      if=schedule:aov,push_log
      if=schedule:aps,push_log
      if=schedule:aua,push_log
      if=schedule:crd,push_log
      if=schedule:crf,push_log
      if=schedule:eur,push_log
      if=schedule:ohg,push_log
      if=schedule:r1,push_log
      if=schedule:r4,push_log
      if=schedule:rd,push_log
      if=schedule:rv,push_log
      if=schedule:t2,push_log

    The 'push_log' procedure could contain:
      log=station
      sy=popen 'plog -l 2>&1' &

    There are a few things to note about this example:

      i. The above commands cover all schedules in the 2018 IVS master
         schedule.  Most stations will only need a subset.  The
         strings shown may need to be updated in the future.

     ii. If a station particapates in only IVS experments, 'sched_end'
         can just call 'push_log' without using 'if' or the commands
         from 'push_log' can be incorporated directly.

    iii. Be careful to be sure there are no naming conflicts with
         other non-IVS experiments.  Some IVS experiments could be
         identified by longer leading strings, although in some cases,
         this may mean that they may need to updated more frequently.

     iv. The STATION and DATA_CENTER environment variables have to
         have been set-up for 'plog'.

      v. The use of 'popen' and the '2>&1' is highly recommended.  It
         allows the output of 'plog', including any error messages, to
         be recorded in the log for information and troubleshooting.

13. Improved example versions of station 'metserver' and metclient'
    programs are included.  The main changes in 'metserver' program is
    detection and reporting if the device reading loop is stuck and
    support for WMT70x (only) wind sensors.  If you use 'metserver'
    and/or 'metclient' programs, it is recommended that you update to
    the new versions.  The new FS version can communicate with either
    the old or new 'metserver' programs. The new FS version can use
    either local or remote instances of 'metserver'.  It is necessary
    to update the 'equip.ctl' if you use 'metserver' for
    meteorological data in the FS.

14. The 'mk5b_mode' command now uses "updsnor" for 'net_protocol' in
    all cases for FlexBuff.  This change was requested/recommended by
    Harro Verkouter (JIVE).  It helps 'scan_check' recognize dropped
    packets as a clue to their being Ethernet issues.

15. The maximum size of the Tcal table as a function of frequency was
    increased to 1200.  This allows 2 MHz spacing of Tcal values for a
    dual polarization 1 GHz bandwidth receiver, with room to spare.
    This change was requested by Jun Yang (Onsala).

16. Added environment variable 'FS_GNPLT_FONTSIZE' to select
    non-default font sizes.  The user can add the environment variable
    (exported) before running 'gnplt' to select non-default font
    sizes.  The default size is '8'.  A possible larger more readable
    font size might be '12'.

17. Support for user devices in 'tsys', 'onoff', and 'fivept' commands
    that don't support measurements of zero level.  This allows
    devices for which 'zero' or baseline signal can't be measured
    conveniently under computer control.  This works best for devices
    that return zero of there is no input, e.g., digital detectors.
    Please see 'help=user_device' for more details.

18. New 'release' string for version number.  With this version of the
    FS it is possible to specify a 'release' string that is appended
    to the FS version number.  It is displayed in the log "Log Opened"
    line and in the output of the FSVERSION command.  The 'drudg'
    opening message does not display the 'release' string at this
    time.

    The release string is derived from the directory name of the FS
    source, which must be of the form:

      fs-VERSION.SUBLEVEL.PATCHLEVEL-string

    e.g.,

      fs-9.11.20-rc1

    For standard releases, the trailing '.string' is omitted.

    The use of '-string' can be used to distinguish between different
    test releases and for other purposes.  The 'string' can up to 32
    characters, but it is desirable to keep it short.  The top-level
    Makefile will extract the FS version and release information from
    the top-level directory that the Makefile is in.  As a result it
    is no longer necessary to update the Makefile for a new directory
    name.

19. Optional Makefile enviroment variable FS_MONIT_ADD_LIB for monit
    family of programs.  This variable can be used specified
    additional local libraries that may be needed for the LIBES
    variable in monit/Makefile.  This variable can be set the 'prog'
    user's environment on login so that it is always available.
    Examples can be found in the .login' and '.profile' files in
    /usr2/fs/st.default/prog for the 'tcsh' and 'bash; shells,
    respectively.  This only needs to be used if the contents of the
    default LIBES variable in the exisiting Makefile is not complete
    for the Linux distribution being used.

A complete history of the various changes and the routines they affect
is in /usr2/fs/misc/changes.txt.

			B. Changes in 'drudg'
				   
'drudg' opening message date is 2018Apr20.

The following is a summary of 'drudg' changes since 9.11.19.

 1. Ad hoc support for 'sched' stagger start mode.
 2. the 'mk5=bank_set?' query was added to the setup procedure for
    Mark 5 recorders.

A more detailed discussion of these changes follows.

 1. Ad hoc support for 'sched' stagger start mode.  In this mode there
    are different recording start times at different stations.  The
    data valid time for a station is the time that the antenna is
    expected to reach the source at that station.  This violates the
    'sked' observation timeline that 'drudg' assumes.  However, with
    advice from Jon Quick (HartRAO), we have tried to make the best
    possible work around that will support this mode.  In this case,
    'drudg' will start recording at the indicated data valid time,
    then execute 'preob', then mark the data valid, then run 'midob'.
    This minimizes the wasted recording time and maximizes the chances
    that a good calibration will be possible when 'preob' is run.  It
    also maximizes the amount of time the data is marked valid after
    'preob' completes because there are no time sequencing commands in
    the schedule between the start of recording through 'midob'.  This
    accomodates continuous or non-continuous calibration 'preob'
    procedures automatically.

 2. the 'mk5=bank_set?' query was added to the setup procedure for
    Mark 5 recorders.  This change was made to support the removal of
    the same query from local 'midob' and 'checkmk5' procedures.
    Originally the command was included in the local 'midob'
    procedure, but it was later recognized that it may fail.  The
    command is added to the setup procedure only if the selected
    recorded is a Mark 5. As a resultq the station procedures can be
    independent of whether a Mark 5 or FlexBuff recorder is in use.

A complete history of the various changes and the routines they affect
is in /usr2/fs/drudg/change_log.txt.

			   C. Known FS Bugs

(The only change in this section since the previous version is the
addition of items #13 and #14.)

The following is a summary list of known bugs. They are described in more
detail after the list.

 1. Do not run 'fmset' for extended periods.
 2. 'odd' and 'even' head types not supported for Mark IV & VLBA4.
 3. 'odd'/'even' head types not supported for VLBA style tapeforms.
 4. CHEKR does not check the status of the Mark IV formatter or Mark 5
    recorder.
 5. Extraneous errors when tape is stopped by low tape sensor.
 6. 'Comm=' command in logex extracts only the first command.
 7. S2 error scheme clumsy.
 8. No extra spaces allowed in 'ibad.ctl' file.
 9. ONOFF and FIVPT programs hang.
10. FS SNAP command pages don't list tape drive suffix numbers.
11. LBA rack TPI detector is not usable.
12. mk5b_mode and bit_stream commands only report the expected sample
    rate.
13. Some fmpsee routines do not report file I/O error through the log
    system.
14. Some systems calls, particularly in mk5cn and dbbcn, use separate
    UN errors to elaborate on errors in system calls.

A more detailed discussion of these bugs follows.

 1. Do not run 'fmset' for extended periods.  For stations that have
    formatter that can be set with 'fmset', the program should not be
    run for extended periods of time.  The 'fmset' program should be
    used only to set or briefly verify that the formatter time is
    correct.  Do not leave 'fmset' running after completing either of
    these tasks, especially during an experiment.

    The 'fmset' program dominates the Field System when it is running
    and this is likely to interfere with the running of an experiment
    or other activities.  The only way to detect the time from the
    VLBA formatter with greater precision than one second it to wait
    for the seconds response from the formatter to change.  This
    requires the FS to communicate with the formatter almost
    continuously.  A similar problem exists for the S2 recorder.  This
    problem is less severe for other formatters, but extended use of
    'fmset' in this case should be avoided as well.  A reminder about
    this is included in the 'fmset' menu.

 2. 'odd'/'even' head types not supported for Mark IV & VLBA4.  The
    Mark IV and VLBA4 rack version of the 'form' command and the Mark
    IV and VLBA4 recorder versions of the 'repro' and 'parity'
    commands do not support the 'odd' and 'even' parameters for the
    read and write head types and reproduce electronics in the
    'head.ctl' control file.  This means that automatic substitution
    of odd or even head in passes that use only even or odd heads
    respectively does not occur.  The only correct settings for the
    read and write head parameters and reproduce electronics is 'all'.
    This will be fixed in a future revision.  Please let Ed know if
    you are missing some tracks and need to work around this
    limitation.

 3. 'odd'/'even' head types not supported for VLBA style tapeforms.
    For any mode recorded with VLBA style tapeform (14 index
    positions), the only correct setting of the read and write head
    types on the 'head.ctl' is 'all'.  This will be fixed in a future
    revision.  Please let Ed know if you are missing some tracks and
    need to work around this limitation.

 4. 'chekr' does not check the status of the Mark IV formatter or Mark
    5 recorder.  Now that most communication problems with the Mark IV
    formatter have been solved, this will be possible and will be done
    in the future.  'chekr' support will be implemented for Mark 5
    despite communication problems, they will have to be ignored
    unless they extend beyond a certain amount of time.

 5. Extraneous errors when tape is stopped by low tape sensor.  When a
    tape drive has been commanded to move the tape and then stops
    because it hit the low tape sensor (or when S2 recorders hit the
    BOT or EOT), 'chekr' will complain periodically that the tape
    drive is not in the correct state.  In principle the FS should be
    smarter about this.  However, if the tape is managed correctly by
    the schedule this error message should never occur.  If it does,
    then it it an indication that there is either a problem with: (1)
    the schedule, (2) the check procedures, (3) the recorder, or (4)
    the tape is too short.  If any of these cases apply they should be
    corrected.  It is more likely that this error message will occur
    when the tape is being controlled manually.  In this case, issuing
    an 'ET' command will convince the FS that the tape drive should be
    stopped and the error message will cease.

 6. 'comm=' command in 'logex' extracts only the first command.  The
    'comm=' command in 'logex' extracts only the first command
    commanded and displayed.  This problem was noted by Giuseppe
    Maccaferri (Medicina).

 7. S2 error scheme clumsy.  The error and status response number
    reporting scheme for S2 recorders is clumsy.  FS errors that have
    mnemonic 'rl' are mostly error responses from the recorder or the
    RCL interface library that is used to communicate with the
    recorder.  If the numeric part of an 'rl' error is greater than
    -130, then it is the error code returned by the recorder.  If the
    numeric part is less than -130, but greater than -300, then add
    130 to the value, the absolute value of the result is the error
    response code from the RCL library.  For values less than or equal
    to -300, a FS error has been detected.  Status response codes are
    all reported with mnemonic 'rz' and the numeric value is the
    negative of the status response code.  In all cases an appropriate
    error or status message is displayed.  These messages are retained
    in the log.

 8. No extra spaces allowed in 'ibad.ctl' file.  The format of the
    'ibad.ctl' must not contain any leading or embedded spaces.  In
    systems that use the LLP AT-GPIB driver (pre-FS Linux 4), if
    either the option 'no_untalk/unlisten_after' is misspelled or an
    incorrect device name is supplied, the driver will cause a
    segmentation violation when it is initialized and the FS will
    terminate.  Unfortunately there is no way to prevent this problem
    in a general way; it reflects a limitation in the driver.

 9. 'onoff' and 'fivpt' programs hang.  The 'onoff' and 'fivpt'
    programs have been known to 'hang' mysteriously.  This seems to be
    caused by some problem with the 'go' mechanism that is used to
    restart the program when it pauses to allow a SNAP procedure, such
    as 'calon' or 'caloff' to execute.  The 'go' that is used to
    restart the program fails for some reason.  This has been
    exceedingly difficult to debug because it is intermittent and
    fairly rare.  There is however a good work around for it.  The
    'calon' and 'caloff' procedures are called by procedures 'calonfp'
    and 'calofffp' for 'fivpt' and 'calonnf' and 'caloffnf' for
    'onoff'.  'fivpt' and 'onoff' may hang during (or actually just
    after) the execution of one these procedures that FIVPT and ONOFF
    will typically hang.  If this happens, you will have to terminate
    the FS to recover.  You can prevent it from happening again (for
    this procedure) by adding the lines:

      !+1s
      sy=go fivpt &

    to the end of 'calonfp' and 'calonfffp'.  For 'calonnf' and
    'caloffnf', please add:

      !+1s
      sy=go onoff &

    If you see other situations where 'fivpt' and 'onoff' hang, please
    let Ed know.

10. FS SNAP command pages don't list tape drive suffix numbers.  The
    FS SNAP manual pages and the help pages available through the
    'help=' command do not reflect when multiple versions are
    available with different suffixes depending on the number of drive
    specified in the control files.  For example, there is only a
    'tape' page, no 'tape1' or 'tape2' page.  However, the help
    facility will display the version of the command with no suffix
    when an available command with a suffix is used.  For example, if
    two drives are defined, then 'help=tape1' and 'help=tape2' will
    work, but 'help=tape' will not and vice-versa if only one drive is
    defined.

11. LBA rack TPI detector is not usable.  The Australian LBA Data
    Acquisition System currently lacks a functional total power
    detector though support has been included.  To allow approximate
    system temperature calibration, all the setup commands and the TPI
    detectors of the modules of a co-existing Mark IV rack are
    currently also available when the rack type is specified to be
    LBA4.

12. 'mk5b_mode' and 'bit_streams' commands only report the expected
    sample rate.  The value of the actual clock rate is not read back
    from the recorder in order to calculate the actual effective
    sample rate.  Consequently, the query log output includes
    parenthesis around the sample rate as indication that it is not
    read, but expected.  The 'mk5c_mode' command does report the
    actual sample sample rate.

13. Some 'fmpsee' routines do not generally report file I/O error
    through the log system for programs within the FS, specifically
    'boss', 'incom', and 'aquir'.  The 'fmpopen()' routine does use
    the log system to report errors.  Those are the most common
    errors.  However other routines report errors with terminal
    output.  These other routines should eventually use the log
    system.

14. Some systems calls, particularly in 'mk5cn' and 'dbbcn', use
    separate UN errors to elaborate on errors in system calls.  These
    should eventually be integrated into the main error message, but
    whether this makes the errors messages too long (maximum 120
    characters) should be considered.


A. Reference Appendix for Installation

This appendix collects several topics that are useful for installation
in general, but are usually not needed for routine updates.

      A.1. Upgrading from FS versions before the previous stable

If you are installing FS9 for the first time with this version, please
follow the installation instructions in Section 4.5 of the FS9
'Computer Reference' manual.  In this case you should also get a copy
of the current FS9 'Control Files and Field System Initialization'
manual.

For reference, the list of the most recent 'critical updates,' since
version 9.3.13, is given below.  These are updates that must be
applied sequentially.  Please start with the next update with a later
version number than what you have and apply it and the following
listed versions before upgrading to 9.11.19.  You can find the latest
versions of installation notes for these FS versions in the
'/usr2/fs/misc' directory.  The list of critical updates is:

  9.4.0
  9.5.3
  9.5.12
  9.6.9
  9.7.7
  9.9.2
  9.10.4
  9.11.6
  9.11.8
  9.11.19

Strictly speaking you do not need to actually use the source archives
(.tgz files) of the previous versions.  You can just follow the steps
in the upgrade notices for the corresponding FS versions.  However, it
can be very helpful to actually install each version to help make sure
that all of the upgrade steps have been completed and that the FS will
run *and* to test it as described.  This can be particularly helpful
when the upgrade requires some modifications to your local programs.
So it probably best to actually install *and* test each version along
the way.  This is especially true if you have to upgrade through more
than one previous version.  Otherwise if a step was overlooked, it
might be hard to identify for which version the error was made.

You can find the archives for old versions at:

  http://lupus.gsfc.nasa.gov/fs/dist/old/

or

  http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/dist/old/

If you have a version older than 9.3.13, please contact Ed
(Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov).

	      A.2. Example standard procedure libraries

For reference purposes, information about the example station
libraries for different equipment configurations is given here.  The
files are found in /usr2/fs/st.default/proc.  They can be referred to
and compared to what you have in '/usr2/proc/station.prc'.

**ONLY** for new installations (or complete re-installs), you can copy
the default version for your equipment to '/usr2/proc' renaming it to
'station.prc' in the process, e.g.:

  cd /usr2/proc
  cp -i /usr2/fs/st.default/proc/3station.prc station.prc
  chmod a+rw station.prc

The '-i' option will prompt before overwriting an existing
'station.prc' to give you a chance to recover if you did not realize
you already had a station.prc file.  The table of correspondence
between equipment types and default library names is given next.

      Equipment        Prefix letters  Station Library

      dbbc/mk5b            d           dstation.prc

If an example for your equipment type is listed, please let Ed
(Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov) know so that it can be added.

		 A.3. Cut-and-paste installation tips

You can use cut-and-paste to reduce the amount of typing involved in
the installation.  This reduces the chances of missing required spaces
and other easily missed characters (like '.') in the commands.  The
basic idea is to have two different terminals open, EITHER (preferred)
two different xterm terminals either on the local X display or
remotely logged in OR (more cumbersome) two different VT text
terminals (Control-Alt-F*, where * is 1-6) on the FS computer you are
upgrading.  You can then switch back and forth between the terminals,
reading the instructions as you scroll through them (with 'more' or
'less') on one terminal and entering commands on the other.  You can
cut-and-paste complicated commands from the terminal with the
instructions to the terminal where you are entering commands as
needed.  You can use 'ssh' or 'su' to 'switch' to users as needed on
the terminal where you are entering commands. For example, you can
change to being 'prog' by executing:

 ssh -X prog@localhost

or

 su - prog

Please don't forget to log back out when you need to change users
again or you may develop a series of 'nested' logins.  Any steps that
require rebooting will of course completely log out all of your
terminals; you will need to re-login again from scratch to continue.
At the end of the update, it is recommended that you login as 'oper'
on the local X display for the final testing.  Please also note that
in order to paste into the X display login shell window for 'oper' and
'prog', you typically must use Shift-Insert.  If you have any
questions about how to cut-and-paste please contact Ed
(Ed.Himwich@nasa.gov).

	       A.4. Making a back-up before installing

Before you begin the upgrade make sure you have a current back-up of
your system in case something goes wrong.  If you are use FS Linux 5
(FSL5), we recommend you use the tar based back-up that is part of the
rotating disk back-up scheme.  A draft document that describes this
method is available in the 'docs' sub-directory on the FS file servers
as 'backups2.pdf'.  If you have an older FS Linux distribution, please
use the disk-to-disk back scheme described in Section 5.8 of the FS9
'Computer Reference' manual.  If you have an FSL6 (sarge), FSL7 (etch)
FSL8 (lenny) configured to run a RAID, please see
/usr2/fs/misc/RAID.pdf section APPLYING AN UPDATE for directions for
applying an update.  If you have FSL9 (wheezy) system configured to
run a RAID, see /usr2/fs/misc/FSL9_RAID.pdf section APPLYING AN UPDATE
for directions for applying an update.  If you are running one of the
FSL distributions and do not have documentation on how to make a
back-up, please contact Ed.  If you have SCSI disks, Section 5.7 of
the FS9 'Computer Reference' manual has a discussion of drive ID
numbers if you are unsure about these.

Normally you should choose to install the update on your primary disk
after having made and verified your back-up.  Once the installation is
complete, has been tested, and used for a little while, you can copy
over your back-up with the upgraded primary.  If the upgrade fails,
you should restore the back-up to the primary for operations.  You can
then try to upgrade again when it is convenient.  In a desperate
situation, you can use the back-up for operations.  You may choose to
install the FS on your back-up disk for testing and then later copy
the back-up onto the primary once you are satisfied with the new
version.  In any event, please be sure to make a fresh back-up (and
put it safely away) before continuing with the installation.

		     A.5. Disk space requirements

Please be sure that you have at least 50 MB of free space (use the
'df' UNIX command to check free space) on your '/usr2' partition
before starting the upgrade.  This would probably only be an issue for
stations with 200 MB disks.  If you are tight on space, you may want
to delete old log files and old versions of the FS (except your most
recent one if you can avoid it of course).  Since you should have
backed-up your system, you can even delete the '*.[oas]' and
executable files of your old versions with no risk.  You might want to
keep the source of the previous versions around for reference if you
have room.  You can eliminate the non-source files by 'cd'-ing to each
of the old FS directories in turn as 'prog' and executing:

  make rmdoto rmexe

as shell command.  If you have any questions about how to do this,
please contact Ed.

		 A.6. Set operations file permissions

It is recommended that your local files for operations (control, proc,
log, and sched directories and their contents) have the default
ownership ('oper.rtx') and permissions ('rw-rw-rw', for directories
'rwxrwxrwx').  To force this, please execute the script (as 'root'):

  /usr2/fs/misc/fix_perm

Answer 'y' to the prompt if you wish to proceed.  It is a good idea to
do this, unless you have purposely changed the ownership and
permissions to some other values.  If you don't want to restore the
defaults, answer 'n' (this is the last chance to abort the execution
of the script).

		  A.7. Fix .prc file 'define' lines

Sometimes due to errors (possibly caused during manual editing,
instead of using PFMED), the 'define' statements in .prc files can be
damaged.  This can lead to other problems including causing the
contents of procedures being logged every time they are executed
rather than just the first time they are used in a given log file.
You can use the utility, /usr2/fs/misc/fix_define to fix this. You can
run it when the FS is *not active* (as 'oper'):

  cd /usr2/proc
  /usr2/fs/misc/fix_define -t *.prc

in 'test' mode to see if there any 'define' statements that need to be
fixed.  If there are, they will be displayed.  If you choose to fix
them, you can re-run the second command above without the '-t' flag to
apply the fix.  An original of each .prc file that is changed is
retained with an added .bak extension.
