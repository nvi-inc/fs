= Make man pages

. _asciidoctor_ version

.. Works pretty well with _asciidoctor_ 2.0.15 (Mac)

.. Does not work so well with _asciidoctor_ 1.5.4 (Debian Stretch)

. Uses _snapcmd.adoc_ as source

.. Level two section is command name/description/equip

.. Level three sections: Syntax, Response, Settable Parameters, Monitor-only Parameters, Comments

.. Syntax and Response use code blocks, with parameters italic

... Bold is very rare, if ever

... Bold italic is never used

.. Settable Parameters and Monitor-only parameters use tables with two columns, no grid or frame

... Those do not translate well to man pages, so _adoc2help_ converts this these to bullet points

... First cell on a line (parameter) are defined with `a| ` at the start of each line

... Vertical bar separating first and second cells has a space on each side

... Second cell on a line are descriptions

... Second cell lines end with ' +' to force new-lines

..  In general:

...  No unconstrained font settings, e.g., no +++__a__b+++, +++**a**b+++, or +++``a``b+++, except:

.... A monospace with constrained italics can be used if the entire token is enclosed
in double back ticks and the unconstrained italics are at the end, e.g, +++``lo__X__``+++. It may be possible
to add more cases.

...  No combination inline fonts except monospace and italics/bold; e.g, +++`_a_`+++ or +++`*a*`+++

... Monospace bold should not be used. It does not translate to man pages as visually different
from bold. However, if makes the html output better it can be used.

. _adoc2help_

.. Extracts  command description from main document

.. Generates _.adoc_ source for man page _troff_ source generation

... Adds required boiler plate

... Fixes up certain font issue for manpage output

.. Runs _asciidoctor_ on generated _.adoc_ source

.. Changes manual section to `FS` in _troff_ man page source

.. Removes intermediate files

. Man pages

.. Syntax and Response sections are considered code blocks

.. In general italics are replaced with underline.

.. man pages are all monospace, so for _.adoc_ source that is:

... Inline monospace -- is replaced with bold

... Monospace and italics/bold --  is converted to underline/bold
