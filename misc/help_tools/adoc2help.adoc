= Make man pages

. _asciidoctor_ version

.. Works pretty well with _asciidoctor_ 2.0.15 (Mac)

.. Does not work so well with _asciidoctor_ 1.5.4 (Debian Stretch)

. Uses _snapcmd.adoc_ as source

.. Level two section is command name/description/equip

.. Level three sections: Syntax, Response, Settable Parameters, Monitor-only Parameters, Comments

.. Syntax and Response use code blocks, with parameters italic

... Bold is very rare, if ever

... Bold italic is never used

.. Settable Parameters and Monitor-only parameters use tables with two columns, no grid or frame

... Those do not translate well to man pages, so _adoc2help_ converts this these to bullet points

... First cell in a row (parameter) are defined with `a| ` at the start of each line

... Vertical bar separating first and second cells has spaces on each
side

... Second cell in a row are descriptions

... Second cell lines end with ` +` to force new-lines

..  In general for inline (non-code block) fonts:

...  The only combined fonts are italics _or_ bold with monospace,
e.g, +++`_a_`+++ _or_ +++`*a*`+++. These are converted by _adoc2help_ to
italics(underline)/bold since the _asciidoc_ `manpage` backend does
not support them (with monospace).

... Bold italics does not work correctly with the _asciidoc_ `manpage`
backend; _adoc2help_ converts bold italics to bold for safety.

... Monospace is converted to bold by _adoc2help_.

... Bold monospace should be avoided. It does not translate to _man_
pages as visually different from bold. However, it can be used if it
makes the HTML output better.

...  No unconstrained font settings, e.g., no +++__a__b+++,
+++**a**b+++, or +++``a``b+++, except:

.... Monospace with constrained italics can be used if the entire
token is enclosed in double back ticks and the unconstrained italics
are at the end, e.g, +++``lo__X__``+++. This is converted to bold _then_
italics (underline). It may be possible to add more cases.

. _adoc2help_

.. Extracts  command description from main document

.. Generates _.adoc_ source for man page _troff_ source generation

... Adds required boiler plate

... Fixes up certain font issue for manpage output

.. Runs _asciidoctor_ on generated _.adoc_ source

.. Changes manual section to `FS` in _troff_ man page source

.. Removes intermediate files

. Man pages

.. Syntax and Response sections are considered code blocks

.. In general italics are replaced with underline.

.. man pages are all monospace, so for _.adoc_ source that is:

... Inline monospace -- is replaced with bold

... Monospace and italics/bold --  is converted to underline/bold
