	      Cable calibration with an HP 53131 counter

		    Ed Himwich and Jonathan Quick

The file describes how to use a HP (or Agilent) 53131 counter for
cable cal.

1. Set the counter's IB address to agree with the value used for
   device "CA" in "ibad.ctl".

2. Include (or modify existing) lines in "stcmd.ctl" for "cable" and
   "cablelong" to look like:

     cable        qkr 1300 01 FFFFFFFFF
     cablelong    qkr 7600 01 FFFFFFFFF

3. Create two SNAP procedures:

     cablen:   cable=:fetc?
               cable

     cablel:   cablelong=:fetc?
               cablelong

4. In "midob" put "cablen" where you would normally put "cable".

5. When doing pre- and/or post- check of the cable cal system, use
   "cablen" in place of "cable" and "cablel" in place of "cablelong".
   Of course a subsequent "cablediff" will calculated the delta and
   sign for you.

6. You can create a "cableinit" procedure to automate setting-up the
   counter in case it loses it configuration because of power failure
   or other issue.

   cableinit:  hpib=ca,*rst
               hpib=ca,:func 'tint 1,2'
               hpib=ca,:even1:hyst:rel 10
               hpib=ca,:even1:lev:abs 1.8
               hpib=ca,:even1:slop pos
               hpib=ca,:inp1:att 1
               hpib=ca,:inp1:coup dc
               hpib=ca,:inp1:filt off
               hpib=ca,:inp1:imp 1000000
               hpib=ca,:even2:hyst:rel 10
               hpib=ca,:even2:lev:abs 1.8
               hpib=ca,:even2:slop pos
               hpib=ca,:inp2:att 1
               hpib=ca,:inp2:coup dc
               hpib=ca,:inp2:filt off
               hpib=ca,:inp2:imp 1000000
               hpib=ca,:init:auto off
               hpib=ca,:init:cont on

   You may need or want to change some of the values and/or make other
   improvements in this procedure.  You can consider calling it from
   "initi" so that each time the FS is started, the counter will be
   set-up, if it isn't too slow.

   A similar set-up procedure can be made for a gps-fmout (or
   fmout-gps) counter and has the advantage of making the triggering
   more repeatable.  To do this basically you would need to adjust the
   device mnemonic (from "ca") and set apprporiate trigger levels for
   the signals on each input.
