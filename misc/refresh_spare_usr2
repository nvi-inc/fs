#To customize this script (as 'root') on the Spare computer:
#   1. Execute the commands:
#        cd /usr/local/sbin
#        cp -a /usr2/fs/misc/refresh_spare_usr2 refresh_spare_usr2
#        chown root.root refresh_spare_usr2
#        chmod a+r,u+wx,go-wx refresh_spare_usr2
#   2. Edit '/usr/local/sbin/refresh_spare_usr2':
#        A. comment out the two echo commands above (add leading '#'s).
#        B  change the 'operational' on the ssh command below to the node name
#           (a fully qualified hostname may be needed) or IP address of
#           the operational machine
#        C. uncomment (delete the leading '#'s) the 15 commands
#            below (#echo "Refreshing ..." ... #echo "Done. ...").
#        D. Save the results
#   3. Test it the first time after a Spare computer disk rotation.
