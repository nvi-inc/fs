To install rc.fs to allocate fs and st resources at boot time.

    log in as root
    prompt> cd /etc/init.d
    prompt> cp -a /usr2/fs/misc/rc.fs fs
    prompt> update-rc.d fs start 90 S

To add other station specific daemons using scripts

    log in as root
    prompt> cd /etc/init.d
    prompt> cp -a <path to script>/<script> <script>
    prompt> update-rc.d <script> default

where you supply the correct <path to script> and <script> name.

For more information, the following suggestions were supplied by
Jonathan Quick (HartRAO):

 First of all you need to read the documentation in

	/etc/init.d/README
	/usr/share/doc/sysvinit/README.runlevels.gz

which I read to say that you shouldn't be starting the daemons in rcS.d
anyway but rather via symlinks in rc2.d, rc3.d, rc4.d and rc5.d.

The easiest way to setup all the required links is to use 'update-rc.d'
so try

	man update-rc.d

for more information, then 

	update-rc.d <scriptname> defaults

to actually do the job on /etc/init.d/<scriptname>.  Apparently the file

	/etc/init.d/skeleton

is an example to base your init.d script on.
