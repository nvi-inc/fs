This file contains a note describing a method to recover a log file
that has been accidently deleted. The chances of this method
succeeding are inversely proportional to how many changes have been
made to the disk since the file was deleted. Please note that the
format of the log entry time stamp has changed since the original note
was written. With the current time stamps, you would enter the shown
commands as:

    # cd /
    # grep ^1997.078 /dev/sda3 > cb302a.log
    # grep ^1997.079 /dev/sda3 > cb302b.log

Please note also if you have IDE disks, the device name would be /dev/hda3.

Thanks to Pablo for figuring this out and writing it up.

 To whom it may concern,

 After the last CORE observation, the person who was observing removed by 
 error the log file we had just produced. Fortunately
 no other operation was done at the PC till we discovered that the file was
 not there. We have been lucky and could recover the whole file. Just in
 case other people may be interested, this is how we managed to recover it.

 1) As root I unmounted the /usr2 partition, to avoid writing on it.
 2) As root we made a search on that partition looking for the character
    string with the date of the two days during which the obsevation 
    was done,

    # cd /
    # grep 97078 /dev/sda3 > cb302a.log
    # grep 97079 /dev/sda3 > cb302b.log

 3) We joined both files, and revised the whole content of it to remove all
    junk that we may have come into it. All lines seem to be ordered in time.

 This operation was possible because,
  - the lost file was ascii
  - all lines of the file are time tagged by the FS.

 Pablo de Vicente.
