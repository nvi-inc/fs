For testing the K4 version of the FS.

I. Introduction

The document describes how to set-up a test system for the K4
release of the FS. The K4 version co-exists with the operational
version. The procedures, control files, logs, and station software are
maintained in separate parallel tracks. Changes made to procedures,
control files, logs, and station software for the K4 version do not
effect the operational version and vice-versa. One consequence of this
is that if want to make a change in both versions you must enter it
twice. Section II describes the set-up which only needs to be done
once. Sections III and IV describe how to change back and forth
between versions with a simple command.

The scripts that make the changes between versions will not overwrite
anything if an error occurs. For example, if you try to change to
CURRENT twice in a row you will get an error message stating that
"/usr2/CURRENT already contains some version". If the change is
successful, the machine will automatically reboot, so be sure this is
safe to do before executing one of the scripts in III or IV.

II. Set-up
   1. Place the archive gemini.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/misc/weh/fs-9.3.115.tar.gz
        in /tmp
   2. Log-in as root and execute:
        cd /
        tar -xzf /tmp/fs-9.3.115.tar.gz
        cd /usr2
        mkdir CURRENT
        mkdir K4
        cp -a control proc sched log st-1.0.0 CURRENT    
                                        (replace 1.0.0 with your local version)
        ln -sfn fs-9.3.115 fs
   3. Log-out as root
   4. Log-in as prog
        cd /usr2/control
        /usr2/fs/misc/cmdctlfix2 stcmd.ctl
        rm stcmd.bak
        /usr2/fs/misc/cmdctlfix3 stcmd.ctl
        rm stcmd.bak
        Edit sw.ctl and append a second non-comment line with
          one field (without quotes): "mvme117"
        Edit your SNAP procedures, changing your lo= commands to
          (VLBAi/VLBA4):
            lo=loa,7600.1
            lo=lob,1540.1
            lo=loc,8080.0
          or (Mark III/IV):
            lo=lo1,7600.1
            lo=lo2,1540.1
            lo=lo3,8080.0
          with appropriate channels and freqencies. Please not the total
          effective first LO should be used. The "upconv" command has been
          deleted. Please remove any "upconv" commands in your procedures.
        cd /usr2/log
        rm *                     (delete all the old logs in this directory)
        cd /usr2/fs
        make
        cd /usr2/st
        make rmdoto rmexe all
        cd /usr2/prog
        mkdir versions
        cp -a /usr2/fs/misc/k4/* versions
        cd versions
        Edit K4_TO_CURRENT and change the reference "stfile=st-1.0.0" near the
          top to use your local software version number instead of "1.0.0",
          if it is different. Also change "fsfile=fs-9.3.25" near the top to
          use the version number of the FS you are using instead
          of "9.3.25", if it is different.
        Edit CURRENT_TO_K4 and change the reference "stfile=st-1.0.0" near the
          top to use your local software version number instead of "1.0.0",
          if it is different.
    5. Reboot
       You will now be running the K4 version

III. To change from the K4 version back to your current operational version:
    1. Make sure the FS isn't running.
    2. Log-in as root and execute:
          /usr2/prog/versions/K4_TO_CURRENT
    3. This will automatically reboot

IV. To change from your current operational version back to the K4 version:
    1. Make sure the FS isn't running.
    2. Log-in as root and execute:
          /usr2/prog/versions/CURRENT_TO_K4
    3. This will automatically reboot

VI. If you also have a BETA version installed you cannot switch directly
    between the BETA and K4 versions. You must switch back to the CURRENT
    version and then to the other test version. Sorry for this.
