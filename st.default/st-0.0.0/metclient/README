Field System 'metclient' software.

INFORMATION: 
-----------

Field System Homepage:  http://lupus.gsfc.nasa.gov/fs

The metclient will download Paroscientific, Inc. MET3 (Meteorological 
Measurement System) and Handar TSI Company (Ultrasonic Wind Sensors) 
information from metserver and parse it into the log file that was 
specified by the user in the metlog.ctl file.

Read the INSTALL for installation instructions.

LOG FILE NAME:
-------------

The log file name will look like this:

   filename example: wx02301GG.log

	wx: indicates weather type log.
        02: Year
       301: day
        GG: Station
      .log: log extension. 


Each day will have it's own log file, where the Day number will be the 
only change to the file name.

exceptions:
1.) The Year will change in the file name if you've crossed into another year.
2.) If you rename you Station ID in the metlog.ctl control file.

HEADER:
------

At the start of each new day, a new log file will be generated. The log will 
have a header as the beginning line (each new log will begin with a header). 
All times are UT time.

OTHER CLIENTS:
-------------

Any client can receive weather and wind sensor data from this server by 
using PORT 30384.

Clients data format: 

   Temperature,Pressure,Humidity,windSpeed,windDirection

   4.9,1015.0,90.6,1.2,301


ERRORS:
-------

Errors from standalone weather logging client will go to /tmp/metclient.error
file, /var/log/syslog, and an email will be sent to the operator. metclient
WILL NOT exit on any errors.

For the Field System. All errors are handle by the Field System and logged 
like any other observing error.

PROBLEMS:
--------

If you get an error regarding the metserver and/or the metclient, that you 
can't correct and you want to stop either or both of the programs you will
need to kill the metserver and/or the metclient manually. They will not exit
on errors.

 (This will give you the PID's for both the metserver and/or the metclient, 
  whichever is running at the time:)

   prompt> log in as root
   prompt> ps -ef | grep met
   prompt> kill PID

example:
   prompt> ps -ef | grep met

   prog     13526     1  0 16:39 ?        00:00:00 /usr2/st/metserver/metserver /dev/ttyS19 /dev/ttyS18
   root     13630     1  0 16:53 pts/3    00:00:00 /usr2/st/metclient/metclient /usr2/st/metclient/metlog.ctl
   prog     13815 13533  0 17:43 pts/3    00:00:00 grep met

   prompt> kill 13526 13630
