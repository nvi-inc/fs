GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------
Installation is fairly simple. This software can also be run without any
Field System software.

1.) Install the Server first '/usr2/st/metserver'

2.) Make sure all requirements listed above are met. 

    metclient
     |-- Makefile    - The make file for compiling Library, Server and Client.
     |-- INSTALL     - Installation instructions for client(s).
     |-- README              - Information.
     |-- metclient.sh        - bootup script.
     |-- metclient           - executable.
     |-- lib                 - Source directory empty left for future use?.
     |-- metlog.ctl.example  - example of file logging and station information.
     `-- src                 - Source directory for Client and Server.
         |-- Makefile        - The make file for compiling client.
         |-- err_report.c    - Error handler.
         |-- logwx.c         - Format and send information to logging file.
         `-- metclient.c     - Client source for logging weather information.


3.) If you would like to startup a client for logging data.
    NOTE: The client is only needed if you would like to create a log file
          with only weather data. The Field System (FS) does not need this
          client to log data in your station observing file. The FS has it's
          own client that works with your existing 'wx' SNAP command. 

    prompt> log in as prog
    prompt> cd /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0
    prompt> cp -a metclient /usr2/st
    prompt> cd /usr2/st/metclient
    prompt> make

    NOTE2: Since this dosen't need to be remade with each Field System
           update please do not include the metclient directory in the 
           global /usr2/st/Makefile.

4.) If you are going to run a client to create a weather data log.
    Using your favorite editor create a control file for the client. 
    For completeness sake you should call it metlog.ctl and put it in 
    /usr2/st/metclient directory. Remember that this is an example and 
    you must create the file to match your enviroment.

    vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'metlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/st/metclient' directory you MUST 
    change the metclient.sh script mentioned at Item 2.) in STARTING CLIENT. 
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    An example exists in your metclient directory.

    example metlog.ctl.example file:
	*=COMMENT.
	*metget.ctl
	gg            station two-letter code
	0             place holder for sampling period for wind data (not used)
	60            logging period for all data (seconds)
	/usr2/log/wx  directory for logging data, must be < 27 characters
	GGAO7108      Station Name
	76.8265       Longitude
	39.0219       Latitude
	14.99         Station Elevation
	*
   
    The directory listed must exist. On a FS computer, we recommend you 
    create it logged in as "root" woth these commands:

       cd /usr2/log
       mkdir wx
       chmod a+rw wx
       chown oper.rtx wx

STARTING CLIENT:
----------------

1.) Running the metclient. Please run metclient from root.

    NOTE: The first parameter is the control file that was created by you
            in the /usr2/st/metclient directory.
          The second parameter is the network port of the server, if
            you are not using the default, you must specify
            it after the first parameter, 50001 is the default.
          The third parameter is the host for the server, if you are not
            using the default you must specify it after the second 
            parameter. Default value is 'localhost'. The host can be
            either a hostname, or an IPv4 address in standard dot notation.
            If the metserver is run on the same computer 'localhost' will
            always work. Providing the name or ip-address of the computer 
            will only let the metclient connect to the metserver if the 
            server enabled remote connections.


   prompt> log in as root.
   prompt> /usr2/st/metclient/metclient /usr2/st/metclient/metlog.ctl 50001
           localhost &

2.) If you would like metclient to startup at boot time.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'metlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/st/metclient' directory you MUST 
    MUST change the metclient.sh script. 

    Likewise if you aren't using the default network port you must specify
    it in the metclient.sh script.
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    prompt> log in as root
    prompt> cd /etc/init.d
    prompt> cp /usr2/st/metclient/metclient.sh .
    prompt> update-rc.d metclient.sh defaults

    Everytime you reboot your system, the metclient will start logging 
    automatically.

    a.) If you wish to stop the metclient for some reason.
	as root:
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh stop  (will stop the metclient)
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh start (will start it up again)
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh restart (will stop then start)

    b.) If you no longer want the server to startup at boot time you have
        two options. You can either remove the service or disable it.
        
        Removing:
        prompt> log in as root
        prompt> cd /etc/init.d
        prompt> rm metclient.sh
        prompt> update-rc.d -f metclient.sh remove
 
        Disabling:
        There is no option to use when calling update-rc.d that will
        disable the script (yet). This can be achieved manually by 
        renaming the script in /etc/init.d, for example:
        prompt> cd /etc/init.d
        prompt> mv metclient.sh metclient.sh.disabled

        NOTE: When invoking update-rc.d with the remove option the script
              should have been deleted already. Flag '-f' will force removal
              of symlinks even if /etc/init.d/metclient.sh still exists

 ===== Read the README file for logfile names and log file information. =====

You're done!

NOTES:
------

1. If the metclient saved a string without met data in the log file we might 
   be able to tell from the string what happened.
   There are two possible "error" strings that give us information:

   a) A string with only date, time and 'wx' tell us that the metclient
      did not retrieve any data at all from the metserver. 
      Example: 2013.119.14:07:00/wx/
      This will happen if the metserver is no longer running.

   b) A string with date, time, 'wx' and three commas tell us that the 
      metclient did retrieve data from the metserver, but the data was
      badly formatted.
      Example: 2013.119.14:07:00/wx/,,,
