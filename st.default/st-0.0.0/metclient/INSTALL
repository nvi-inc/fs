GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------
Installation is fairly simple. This software can also be run without any
Field System software.

1.) Install the Server first '/usr2/st/metserver'

2.) Make sure all requirements listed above are met. 

    metclient
     |-- Makefile    - The make file for compiling Library, Server and Client.
     |-- INSTALL     - Installation instructions for client(s).
     |-- README      - Information.
     |-- metclient.sh - bootup script.
     |-- metclient   - executable.
     |-- lib       - Source directory empty left for future use?.
     |-- metlog.ctl    - example of file logging and station information.
     `-- src           - Source directory for Client and Server.
         |-- Makefile  - The make file for compiling Server and Client.
         |-- err_report.c - Error handler.
         |-- logwx.c   - Format and send information to logging file.
         `-- metclient.c  - Client source for logging weather information.


3.) If you would like to startup a client for logging data.
    NOTE: The client is only needed if you would like to create a log file
          with only weather data. The Field System (FS) does not need this
          client to log data in your station observing file. The FS has it's
          own client that works with your existing 'wx' SNAP command. 

    prompt> log in as prog
    prompt> cd /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0
    prompt> cp -a metclient /usr2/st
    prompt> cd /usr2/st/metclient
    prompt> make

    NOTE2: Since this dosen't need to be remade with each Field System
           update please do not include the metclient directory in the 
           global /usr2/st/Makefile.

4.) If you are going to run a client to create a weather data log.
    Using your favorite editor create a control file for the client. 
    For completeness sake you should call it metlog.ctl and put it in 
    /usr2/st/metclient directory. Remember that this is an example and 
    you must create the file to match your enviroment.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'metlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/st/metclient' directory you MUST 
    change the metclient.sh script mentioned at Item 2.) in STARTING CLIENT.

    An example exists in your metclient directory.

    example metlog.ctl.example file:
	*=COMMENT.
	*metget.ctl
	GG            station two-letter code
	0             place holder for sampling period for wind data (not used)
	1200          logging period for all data (seconds)
	/usr2/log     directory for logging data, must be < 27 characters

	76.8265       Longitude

STARTING CLIENT:
----------------

1.) Running the metclient. Please run metclient from root.

    NOTE: Only one parameter is needed for metclient; the control file 
          which was created by you in the /usr2/st/metclient directory.

   prompt> log in as root.
   prompt> /usr2/st/metclient/metclient /usr2/st/metclient/metlog.ctl&

2.) If you would like metclient to startup at boot time.

    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'metlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/st/metclient' directory you MUST 
    MUST change the metclient.sh script. 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    prompt> log in as root
    prompt> cd /etc/init.d
    prompt> cp /usr2/st/metclient/metclient.sh .
    prompt> update-rc.d metclient.sh defaults

    Everytime you reboot your system, the metclient will start logging 
    automatically.

    a.) If you wish to stop the metclient for some reason.
	as root:
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh stop  (will stop the metclient)
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh start (will start it up again)
	/etc/init.d/metclient.sh restart (will stop then start)
