Standalone 'tacdclient' software.

INFORMATION: 
-----------
Field System Homepage:  http://lupus.gsfc.nasa.gov/fs

The tacdclient will download Tac32+ information from the TAC32 PC and send
it to the log file that was specified by the user in the tacdlog.ctl file.

Read the INSTALL for installation instructions.

LOG FILE NAME:
-------------
The log file name will look like this:

   filename example: tacd02301GG.log

      tacd: indicates weather type log.
        02: Year
       301: day
        GG: Station
      .log: log extension. 


Each day will have it's own log file, where the Day number will be the 
only change to the file name.

exceptions:
1.) The Year will change in the file name if you've crossed into another year.
2.) If you rename you Station ID in the tacdlog.ctl control file.

HEADER:
------

At the start of each new day, a new log file will be generated. The log will 
have a header as the beginning line (each new log will begin with a header). 
All times are UT time.

TAC INFORMATION FORMAT:
--------------------------
2003.063.16:06:47.00/tacd/time,d.f,ss,aa,g.ggg,t.tttt,c.cccc	
or
2003.063.16:06:47.00/tacd/average,d.f,sec,rms,max,min,average

       2002: Year
        301: day
         00: hour
         12: minutes
      46.00: seconds
     /tacd/: tacd indicator
       time: time or average indicator
        d.f: Epoch of value reported in time or average response. 
             The integer d portion is either yyddd or MJD or Excel date 
             (days since 1900.0), depending on how the software in host 
             is set-up. The fractional f portion is the fraction of a day,
             in steps of 0.000001 days.
     t.tttt: Raw reading on the counter in microseconds.
         ss: ONCORE receiver's +/- 52 nanoseconds sawtooth correction to the
             raw GPS 1PPS in nanoseconds.
         aa: An estimate of the accuracy of the raw GPS tick in nanoseconds.
      g.ggg: Amount by which the GPS receiver's 1PPS output has been 
             intentionally biased in microseconds.
      c.ccc: Corrected (cooked) counter reading after applying the ss and
             g.ggg corrections.
        sec: Number of seconds (samples) of data going into average.
        rms: RMS scatter of the sec data points about the average in 
             microseconds.
    average: The sec point average of the sec cooked counter readings in 
             microseconds.
        max: The extreme readings of the sec points.
        min: The extreme readings of the sec points.
 
OTHER CLIENTS:
-------------
Any client can receive tacd data from the TAC32 PC server by using PORT 32325.

ERRORS:
-------
Errors from standalone tacd logging client will go to /tmp/tacdclient.error
file, /var/log/syslog, and an email will be sent to the operator. tacdclient
WILL NOT exit on any errors.

For the Field System. All errors are handle by the Field System and logged 
like any other observing error.

PROBLEMS:
--------
If you get an error with regards the tacdclient that you can't correct and
you want to stop the program, you will need to kill the tacdclient manually.
It will not exit on errors.

This will give you the PID's for the tacdclient that is running at the time:

   prompt> log in as root
   prompt> ps -ef | grep tacdclient
   prompt> kill -15 PID

example:
   prompt> ps -ef | grep tacdclient

   prog     31850 29135  0 17:33 pts/5    00:00:00 tacdclient /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0/tacdclient/tacdlog.ctl

   prompt> kill -15 31850
