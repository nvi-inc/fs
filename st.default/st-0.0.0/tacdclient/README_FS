tacd - TAC Field System SNAP client command.

 HOST name or IP address,PORT number are in the /usr2/control/tacd.ctl file.

 Function that uses this information:
 /usr2/fs/quikv/tacd.c	/* This client retrives TAC information. Displays and
                           logs using the function tacd_dis.c. tacd is also
                           responsible for placing information on to Shared
                           Memory /usr2/fs/include/tacd_shm.h */ 

 There are a few things that can be done with the tacd function.

 When you start the Field System and type:
 >tacd         /* displays TAC average */

 You can change this by typing:

 >tacd=time    /* displays TAC time. */
 >tacd=average /* displays TAC average time. */
 >tacd=status  /* displays TAC status. */
 >tacd=version /* displays TAC version. This will only display once, then 
                  to back to the default. */
 Once you've done this it will continue to display what you requested, by
 simply typing tacd without any parameters, except the tacd=version.

example:
20:03:28;tacd=status
20:03:28/tacd/status,tacggao.gsfc.nasa.gov,32325,C:\gps\tac\12gg063A.csv,OPENED
20:03:30;tacd
20:03:30/tacd/status,tacggao.gsfc.nasa.gov,32325,C:\gps\tac\12gg063A.csv,OPENED

It will continue, until you change it.

average example:
>tacd=average	
 will log:
18:23:38;tacd=average
18:23:38/tacd/average,NEW,36647.765625,300,0.016172,11.063171,11.093600,11.028600

 If the time is old - it will be labeled OLD:
>tacd
18:24:44;tacd=average
18:24:44/tacd/average,OLD,36647.765625,300,0.016172,11.063171,11.093600,11.028600
