GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------
Installation is fairly simple. This software can also be run without any
Field System software.

1.) The server already exits on the Tac32 PC.
    
    To activate the remote on the Tac32 PC.
	a.) type: Control T on the TAC PC.
        b.) Select remote. (leave port as default 32325).

2.) Make sure all requirements listed above are done.

	|   |-- logtacd.c
	|   `-- tacdclient.c
	|-- tacdclient
	|-- tacdclient.sh
	`-- tacdlog.ctl

3.) If you would like to startup a client for logging data.
    NOTE: The client is only needed if you would like to create a log file
          with only TAC data. The Field System (FS) does not need this
          client to log data in your station observing file. The FS has it's
          own client that works with your existing 'tacd' SNAP command. 

    prompt> log in as prog
    prompt> cd /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0
    prompt> cp -a tacdclient /usr2/st
    prompt> cd /usr2/st/tacdclient
    prompt> make

    NOTE2: Since this doesn't need to be remade with each Field System
           update please do not include the tacdclient directory in the 
           global /usr2/st/Makefile.

4.) If you are going to run a client to create a TAC data log.
    Using your favorite editor create a control file for the client. 
    For completeness sake you should call it tacdlog.ctl and put it in 
    /usr2/st/tacdclient directory. Remember that this is an example and 
    you must create the file to match your environment.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'tacdlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/st/tacdclient' directory you MUST 
    change the tacdclient.sh script mentioned at Item 2.) STARTING CLIENT.

STARTING CLIENT:
----------------

1.) Running the tacdclient. Please run tacdclient from root.

    NOTE: Only one parameter is needed for tacdclient; the control file 
          which was created by you in the /usr2/st/tacdclient directory.

   prompt> log in as root.
   prompt> /usr2/st/tacdclient/tacdclient /usr2/st/tacdclient/tacdlog.ctl&

2.) If you would like tacdclient to startup at boot time.

    If you name the control file by any other name, other then 'tacdlog.ctl'
    and/or you don't put it the '/usr2/st/tacdclient' directory you MUST 
    MUST change the tacdclient.sh script.

    prompt> log in as root
    prompt> cd /etc/init.d
    prompt> cp /usr2/st/tacdclient/tacdclient.sh .
    prompt> cd /etc/rcS.d
    prompt> ln -sfn ../init.d/tacdclient.sh S93tacdclient.sh

    Every time you reboot your system, the tacdclient will start logging 
    automatically.
