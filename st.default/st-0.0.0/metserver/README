Field System 'metserver' software.

INFORMATION: 
-----------

Field System Homepage:  http://lupus.gsfc.nasa.gov/fs

The metserver gets Paroscientific, Inc. MET3 (Meteorological 
Measurement System) and Handar TSI Company (Ultrasonic Wind Sensors) 
information on rquest from client.

Read the INSTALL for installation instructions.

THE SERVER:
-------------

metserver will call on metget to retrive information from MET3 and Wind 
Sensor by using the ports that you have designated. 
example: /dev/ttySx /dev/ttySx

Information will be read from named /dev/ports on request for the
client returned to the client.

ERRORS:
-------

Errors from metserver will go to /tmp/metserver.error file, /var/log/syslog, 
and an email will be sent to the operator. metserver WILL NOT exit on errors.

PROBLEMS:
--------

If you get an error regarding the metserver and/or the metclient, that you 
can't correct and you want to stop either or both of the programs you will
need to kill the metserver and/or the metclient manually. They will not exit
on errors.

 (This will give you the PID's for both the metserver and/or the metclient, 
  whichever is running at the time:)

   prompt> log in as root
   prompt> ps -ef | grep met
   prompt> kill PID

example:
   prompt> ps -ef | grep met

   prog     13526     1  0 16:39 ?        00:00:00 /usr2/st/metserver/metserver/dev/ttyS19 /dev/ttyS18
   root     13630     1  0 16:53 pts/3    00:00:00 /usr2/st/metclient/metclient/usr2/st/metclient/metlog.ctl
   prog     13815 13533  0 17:43 pts/3    00:00:00 grep met

   prompt> kill 13526 13630
