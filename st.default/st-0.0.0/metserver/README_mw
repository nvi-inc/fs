Field System 'metwind' software.

INFORMATION: 
-----------

Field System Homepage:  http://lupus.gsfc.nasa.gov/fs

The metwind gets Paroscientific, Inc. MET3 (Meteorological 
Measurement System) and Handar TSI Company (Ultrasonic Wind Sensors) 
information.

This diagnostic software will be compiled when the metserver is
compiled and installed.


THE METWIND:
------------

metwind retrive from and send commands to MET3 and Wind 
Sensor by using the ports that you have designated. 
example: /dev/ttySx /dev/ttySx

You need to modify the met.ctl file that is provided for you.
the first port: /dev/ttySx is the metsensor.
the second port: /dev/ttySx is for the windsensor.

Information will be read and send from the named /dev/ports

Examples:
   prompt> metwind pres
   prompt> metwind humi
   prompt> metwind wind
or
   prompt> metwind "*0100P3" - which is the command to retrive temp.
   prompt> metwind "*0100EW*0100UN=2" - to send a command 
                                       (to change to mbars in this case.
   "*0100EW" send command to "*0100UN" change units "=2" to milibars.

You also have a widget to do this with named vue_metdisp.

   prompt> vue_metdisp & - will bring up a useful display.

It can also be compiled and run standalone.

cp /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0/metserver/src/metwind.c
cp /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0/metserver/src/met.ctl
cp /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0/metserver/src/MakeDiag
cp /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0/metserver/src/vue_metdisp

To whatever directory you want.
run make
prompt> make -f MakeDiag

define the ports in met.ctl file.
prompt> emacs or vi met.ctl
/dev/ttySx whatever port you metsensor is attached to.
/dev/ttySx whatever port you windsensor is attached to.

run vue_metdisp 
prompt> vue_metdisp &

OR 
run metwind.
prompt> metwind "xxxxxx" get the commands from the manual.
