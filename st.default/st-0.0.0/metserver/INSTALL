GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------
Installation is fairly simple. This software can also be run without any
Field System software.

1.) Make sure all requirements are met.

     |   `-- portwrite.c
     `-- src           - Source directory for Server.
         |-- Makefile  - The make file for compiling Server.
         |-- err_report.c  - Generate error for logging.
         |-- metget.c  - This is the workhorse that talks to the hardware.

2.) Getting the metserver and producing an executable.
   
   prompt> log in as prog
   prompt> cd /usr2/fs/st.default/st-0.0.0
   prompt> cp -a metserver /usr2/st
   prompt> cd /usr2/st/metserver
   prompt> make

   NOTE: Since this doesn't need to be remade with each Field System
         update, please do not include the metserver directory in the 
         global /usr2/st/Makefile.


STARTING MET SERVER:
--------------------

1.) Running the metserver. The ports mentioned here might not be the ports 
    you are connected to, so make sure you have the right ports.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You must supply values (even if the default) for all
                parameters that preceed a parameter with a non-default
                value.

                The first parameter should be the MET3 Sensor device.
                The second parameter should be the WIND Sensor device.
                  (if you don't have the wind sensor simply use '/dev/null' 
                   or leave blank.)
                The third parameter is the network port that is served, if
                  you are not using the default, you must specify
                  it after the first two parameters, 50001 is the default
                The fourth parameter is used to make the 
                  server allow connections from a remote host. To accept 
                  remote connections the parameter should be 'remote'. 
                  Default is to NOT allow remote connections.
                  If the parameter is not used only metclients run 
                  on the same computer with the third parameter 'localhost'
                  will be able to connect. 
                  If the metclient is called with the hostname/ip-address 
                  of the server it will not be allowed to connect unless 
                  the 'remote' option is used.
                The fifth parameter is the met device. Currently
                  the device is assumed to be MET4, but if MET4A is specified
                  the fan is monitored and an error is reported. Any other
                  values are currently equivalent to MET4, which also supports
                  MET3.

    prompt> log in as root
    prompt> /usr2/st/metserver/metserver /dev/ttyS19 /dev/ttyS18 50001 &
                                         (metsensor) (windsensor)

2.) If you would like metserver to startup at boot time.
    Special NOTICE: Please edit the script to use your port locations,
                    before you proceed.

    Modify MET= and WIND= with your own port numbers and PORT= with your
    own network port number (if not default) in the metserver.sh file.

    prompt> log in as root
    prompt> cd /etc/init.d
    prompt> cp /usr2/st/metserver/metserver.sh .
    prompt> update-rc.d metserver.sh defaults

    Everytime you reboot your system, the metserver will start automatically.

    a.) If you wish to stop the metserver for some reason.
        as root:
        /etc/init.d/metserver.sh stop  (will stop the metserver)
        /etc/init.d/metserver.sh start (will start it up again)
        /etc/init.d/metserver.sh restart (will stop then start)

    b.) If you no longer want the server to startup at boot time you have
        two options. You can either remove the service or disable it.
        
        Removing:
        prompt> log in as root
        prompt> cd /etc/init.d
        prompt> rm metserver.sh
        prompt> update-rc.d -f metserver.sh remove
 
        Disabling:
        There is no option to use when calling update-rc.d that will
        disable the script (yet). This can be achieved manually by 
        renaming the script in /etc/init.d, for example: 
        prompt> cd /etc/init.d
        prompt> mv metserver.sh metserver.sh.disabled

        NOTE: When invoking update-rc.d with the remove option the script
              should have been deleted already. Flag '-f' will force removal
              of symlinks even if /etc/init.d/metserver.sh still exists.   

 ===== Read the README information. =====

You're done!

NOTES:
------

1. Because this is hardware that may or may not exist for your system. You
must make sure to include the cdp(default) or port & server in your existing 
/usr2/control/equip.ctl file.

Example:

* Please refer to the Control Files Manual in Volume 1 of the 
* Field System Documentation
* 
*  VLBI equipment
mk3     type of rack (mk3, vlba, vlbag, mk4, vlba4,
.
.
.   
* met sensor type: cdp or two fields for metserver: port hostname 
*default choice for metserver is  50001   localhost      
cdp     cdp or met3 server port & host, use cdp if you don't have either


2. If the kernel you are using is older than version 2.6 the command 
'metserver.sh start' will result in three processes running for the 
metserver. This is due to the 'one process per thread' model. The
metserver consists of one initial thread and creates one thread.
The third process corresponds to the 'thread manager' thread.
This is not an error, but it will cause a warning when trying to
stop the metserver with the command 'metserver.sh stop'. After
killing the first process it will try to kill the other two,
but they disappear after killing the first one resulting in a 
warning looking like:

"Stopping MET Server: metserver start-stop-daemon: warning: 
failed to kill 1211: No such process
start-stop-daemon: warning: failed to kill 1212: No such process"

Here 1211 and 1212 are just examples of what the PID might be for
the extra processes.
There will not be more than one process for the metserver on most modern
Linux systems if they are using NPTL.
