			The History of PREDICT
			======================
			    
Work on PREDICT started on May 26, 1991 with the purpose of creating a
replacement for QUIKTRAK software that ran on the Commodore 64 home
computer.  PREDICT was originally written in C and compiled using a
"Super C" compiler.  After the program was completed and found to be
useful, PREDICT was then ported to several Unix machines and then to
DOS using a Borland Turbo C++ compiler.  The DOS version was completed
in May 1994 and was the first version of PREDICT released to the public.
PREDICT was later ported to the Linux operating system in 1995 and
released as freeware as a pre-compiled a.out dynamically linked
binary in 1996.

Through years of daily use, PREDICT was found to be reliable and accurate,
and only minor changes were made to the program until 1999 when major
portions were re-written from scratch and many new features were added.

The release of PREDICT version 2.0.0 in December 1999 represents the
second major release of the program.

Further details regarding the history of PREDICT are available in the
July 2000 (Science and Engineering) issue of "Linux Journal" magazine.

The release of PREDICT version 2.2.0 in October 2002 represents the
third major release of the program.

This version of PREDICT was written under Slackware Linux on a 100 MHz
Pentium-based PC with 16 megabytes of RAM using the "vi" editor.
