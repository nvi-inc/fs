SGP4/SDP4 models and sun/moon position algorithms used in this
version of PREDICT were derived from "satcom-08", written by
Neoklis Kyriazis, 5B4AZ, and released in 2002 under the GNU
General Public License.  Parts of "satcom-08" were derived
through a translation into 'C' of SGP4 and SDP4 code written
originally in FORTRAN and Pascal by Dr. T.S. Kelso.  Dr. Kelso's
code is available on his web site at http://www.celestrak.com/.

Socket-based server code and the "map" client application were
contributed by Ivan Galysh, KD4HBO on 10-Jan-2000.

PIC/TRACK antenna rotator control code was contributed by
Vittorio Benvenuti, I3VFJ on 13-Jul-2000.

The "gsat" client was contributed by Xavier Crehueras, EB3CZS.

The Perl client demonstration program was contributed by Rich
Parry, W9IF.

The WinPredictClient was contributed by Steve Fraser, VK5ASF.

The concept of using "xearth" as a graphical display for PREDICT
was originally conceived by Wade Hampton (that later developed
into "earthtrack").

Many others have contributed code to the project, including
Bent Bagger OZ6BL, Tom Busch WB8WOR, Steve Fraser VK5ASF,
Xavier Crehueras, EB3CZS, Takeshi-Okazaki (Satellite Engineer
for MTSAT-1R (HIMAWARI 6)), and others.

Calculations for squint angle were adopted from trk-0.4.1 by Lapo
Pieri, IK5NAX.

PREDICT is also the product of many others who have contributed
bug reports, bug fixes, helpful suggestions, and positive support.
