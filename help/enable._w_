       enable - enable recording heads (VLBA, VLBA4 drives)

Syntax:     enable=list-of-groups

Response:   enable/list-of-groups


Settable parameters:
list-of-groups  List of head groups to be enabled/disabled.
                Groups are specified by gn, n=0 to 3. In
                addition, for VLBAB or VLBA4 drives,  groups in
                headstack two can specified by gn, n=4 to 7. A null list
                (i.e. enable=) disables all heads. For mode D,
                the group containing a single track to be
                recorded may be indicated by setting list-of-
                groups to dn, n = 1 to 28. The group within which
                Mark III track n occurs will be enabled. In
                addition, for VLBAB and VLBA4 drives, the group
                in headstack two containing a single track to be
                recorded may be indicated by setting list-of-
                groups to dn, n = 101 to 128.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The use of * as a parameter is not supported by this command.

This command enables groups of heads in the VLBA recorder. Heads
may not be individually enabled. The form command sets up which
data goes to which head with the cross-point switch. 

In mode D, an entire group of heads is enabled. The VLBA rack 
form (and trackform and tracks) command must be used to send data
to a specific head so that only it has data going to it. It is
not possible to record in mode D for a Mark III (or IV) rack/VLBA
(or VLBAB or VLBA4) drive combination.

        g0 includes Mark III heads 1,3,5,7,11,13.
        g1 includes Mark III heads 2,4,6,8,10,12,14.
        g2 includes Mark III heads 15,17,19,21,23,25,27.
        g3 includes Mark III heads 16,18,20,22,24,26,28.
  
Note that a VLBA or Mark IV track number equals the Mark III
track number plus 3. Consequently, odd Mark III tracks are even
VLBA or Mark IV track numbers and vice-versa. See the Track
Assignment Tables in the System Setup manual. Also VLBA group
numbers equal Mark III group numbers minus one, but the VLBA
groups include additional tracks. Note that this command uses
VLBA track and group numbers.

The groups g4, g5, g6, and g7 correspond to groups 0, 1, 2, and 3
on head 2. The parameters, dn, n = 101 to 128, correspond to the
Mark III heads in headstack two given by n-100. The command
accepts these parameters, but normally a VLBA4 drive is not wired
so that this has will have any practical effect. However for a
VLBAB these parameters may be useful.
