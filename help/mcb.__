                     mcb - MCB Communications

Syntax:     mcb=module,reladdr,value

Response:   mcb/value


Settable Parameters:
module    Module mnemonic indicating which module is to be
          addressed. Only standard module mnemonics allowed. Use
          null to indicate that the following address is an
          absolute address.
reladdr   Relative MCB address (hex), i.e. the offset from the
          module's base address. This is the address to be read if
          a value is not given. This is the address to write to if
          a value is given. If module is null, then this is an
          absolute address.
value     Value (hex) to be written into reladdr. Omit this
          parameter if you want to read reladdr.

Monitor-only Parameters:
value     Value (hex) that was read from reladdr, if a value was not
          specified in the command. If a value was specified in the
          command, then the response is the status of the write:
          OK, BUSY, ERR.

Comments:
This command is analgous to the Mark III mat command. This command
is used to read values from or write values to a specific MCB
address. 

If the command is issued as mcb=module,reladdr then the response is
the hex value at reladdr. 

If the command is issued as mcb=module,reladdr,value then the value is
downloaded into reladdr and the response is the status.
