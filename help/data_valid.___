            Syntax:     data_valid=record,playback

            Response:   data_valid/record,playback


Settable parameters:
            record      Flag is on (default) or off.
            playback    Playback enable is use (default) or ignore. S2
            recorders only.

Monitor-only parameters: None.

Comments:
For S2 recorders, this command can be used to set and monitor
the value of the data valid and playback enable flags written
to the tape.

For non-S2 recorders, this command just sets an internal
software flag in the FS indicating that data is valid.
Depending on how the pcald has been set-up this may turn
automatic phase-cal extraction on or off.

For all equipment types, this command is used to indicate in
the log when the data is expected to valid based on the
slewing algorithms of the scheduling program.
