LVDT - Narrow track head positioning by LVDT voltage

Syntax:   LVDT=<cmdVw>,<cmdVr>
          LVDT
Response: LVDT/<cmdVw>,<cmdVr>,<actVw>,<actVr>,
          <deltaVw>,<deltaVr>

Settable parameters:
<cmdVw>: command position voltage for write head, default is don't move
<cmdVr>: command position voltage for read head, default is don't move

Monitor-only parameters:
<actVw>: actual position voltage for write head
<actVr>: actual position voltage for read head
<deltaVw>: voltage difference between actual and commanded write head position
<deltaVr>: voltage difference between actual and commanded read head position

Comments: This command is used to position the narrow track head stacks
in voltage units. An individual head may be moved by not specifying a
command voltage for the other head.

The <delta> parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus commanded.

The command positions reported by the LVDT, PASS, and STACK commands are
consistent. See the description of the PASS command for more information.

If the write head position is commanded, the auxiliary data field is set
to reflect the commanded position, see the PASS command for more information.
