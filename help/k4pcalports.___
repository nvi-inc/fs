             k4pcalports - phase cal extraction ports
 
              Syntax:      pcalports=pca,pcb
 
              Response:    pcalports/pca,pcb,ampa,ampb,phasea,phaseb
 
 
 Settable Parameters:
            pca        Channel A input port number: 1-4 or 9-12
            pcb        Channel B  input port number 5-8 or 13-16
 
 Monitor-only parameters: 
          ampa     Channel A amplitude in voltage percent, uncorrected
          for digital sampling
          ampb     Channel B amplitude in voltage percent, uncorrected
          for digital sampling
          phasea   Channel A phase in degrees
          phaseb   Channel B phase in degrees
 
 Comments:
 This command is available even if a K4 recorder is not being
 used for recording. This allows the phase-cal extraction
 features of the K4, if present, to be utilized at all times.
 
 Some day it will possible to specify the phase-cal extraction
 port may be specified as the port number or as the VC and
 sideband to be used. At that time, the VC and sideband will
 only be displayed if the recpatch command has been used to
 specify which port that VC sideband has been connected to. If
 recpatch command will have specified a VC sideband for the
 requested port, this will be shown in the response rather than
 the port number.
