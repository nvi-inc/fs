        parity - check parity errors (longitudinal drives)

            Syntax:     parity=pemax,syncmax,channel,aux,tracks
          parity

            Response:   parity/parity-errors
          parity/re-sync-errors


Settable Parameters:
          pemax     Maximum allowable parity errors per channel per
          megabyte of data. Default is 600. If errors exceed
          threshold, an error message is issued.
          syncmax   Default is 12. Otherwise handled the same as parity
          error threshold.
          channel   Decoder channel. Can be a, b, or ab (default).
          aux       Aux data check, on (default) or off. Not supported
          for VLBA DQA decoder.
            tracks      List of recorder tracks on which to measure errors.
            "*" (asterisk) as the first list elment preserves previously
            assigned tracks
            Default is the currently enabled tracks. For Mark
            III drives, tracks and must be between 1 and 28,
            and/or may be specified by groups (g1, g2, g3, g4)
            as in the enable command. For Mark IV, and VLBA/4
            drives, tracks must be between 0 and 35, or
            specified by groups (g0, g1, g2, g3) as in the
            enable command, or specified as non-system tracks in
            the VLBA groups (v0, v1, v2, v3),or specified as the
            Mark III  tracks in the VLBA groups (m0, m1, m2,
            m3).

Monitor-only parameters:
                parity-errors   For each track in the list, the corresponding
                parity error rates per megabyte of data per track.
                re-sync-errors  For each track in the list, the corresponding re-
                sync error rates per megabyte of data per track.

Comments:
Issuing this command with an equal sign without or without a
list of parameters sets up the command. Issuing the command
with no equal sign then measures the error rates.

A repro=  must be issued before the parity command will work.
For Mark IV and VLBA/4 this specifies the bit rate. For
Mark III this specifies the next best thing, the reproduce
bandwidth.

This command assumes the read head stack is positioned
appropriately for the tracks that will be read. The heads that
are used to reproduce data are automatically mapped from even
to odd or vice-versa depending on the reproduce electronics
specified in the head.ctl control file. For VLBA and VLBA2
drives the write head parameter controls which heads are used.
If a mixture odd and even heads are requested no mapping is
done.

If the auxiliary data field was set using the form or head
positioning commands, then it is checked for accuracy, unless
the aux parameter is off. An error message is issued if the
auxiliary data on the tape does not agree with the value last
sent to the formatter.

If the log entry for the error rates is too long to fit in one
line, then additional log entries are generated as necessary.
Parity error rates are listed first followed by synch error
rates. The parity error rate log entries  include decimal
points in the numbers to distinguished them from the synch
error log entries which do not.

The decoder channels used to read the data can be specified,
either a, b, or both a and b reproduce channels can be used.
If pcalr is running, it should be suspended before starting
this command so that there's no competition for the b channel.

The data stream is sampled for an amount of time that should
be equivalent to 1 megabyte of data per channel and the
effective error rates per megabyte of data are reported. For
the typical reproduce bit rate of 4 Mbits/sec/track, 1
megabyte corresponds to 2 seconds. For slower bit rates it
will take longer.

The decoder type (mk3, mk4, dqa, or none) must specified on
the second line of the sw.ctl control file.  If the type is
none, the tracks are cycled through with a pause of 2 seconds
between changes to allow visual inspection of the eye-pattern
(and perhaps a K3 decoder if available) even if no supported
decoder is available.

Note that a VLBA or Mark IV track number equals the Mark III
track number plus three. Consequently, odd Mark III tracks are
even VLBA or Mark IV track numbers and vice-versa. See the
Track Assignment Tables in the System Set-up Manual. Also VLBA
group numbers equal Mark III group numbers minus one, but the
VLBA groups include additional tracks. Note that this command
uses VLBA, Mark IV, or Mark III track and VLBA or Mark III
group numbers depending on the type of drive in use.

An asterisk "*" can be used as the first element of the list of tracks
to add additional tracks to be checked. This can be useful for
instance to add system tracks to the default list. For example:
 
parity=
parity=,,,,*,0,1
