Syntax:     tpi=list

Response:   tpi/readings


Settable parameters:
list        List of total power integrators to read back. Standard
            detector mnemonics allowed.

Monitor-only parameters:
readings    List of readings, counts. These values are stored for use
            by the tsys1/2/3 and tsysa/b/c/d commands.

Only USB or LSB total power readings are accepted; if another total
power selection has been set up with the vc command, the reading is
returned as -1. It is assumed the noise calibration signal is off.
