reset - reset the MAT bus
Syntax:         reset=baud

Response:       reset/baud


Settable parameters:
baud            baud rate. MATs support 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800,
                and 9600 baud.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The old MATs (NRAO only) support 2400 baud only. Recommended rate is 9600. A
system reset is sent (break character), then the baud rate is changed, then some
U's to synch up the MATs.
