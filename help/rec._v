Comments:
The feet option of this command is analagous to the Mark III
tapepos command. The zero option is analagous to the Mark
III tape=low,reset command. The other options are unique to
the VLBA recorder.

MCB functions are available. 

The recorder can be re-booted manually by pressing the red
button. After manual reset you must issue the command
rec=addr to re-initialize the module.
