             disc_pos - Mark V byte position pointers

            Syntax:     disc_pos

            Response:   disc_pos/write_pointer, read_pointer


Monitor-only parameters:
                write_pointer   Current write pointer byte position
                read_pointer    Current read pointer byte position

Comments:
This command reports the current position of the write and
read pointers.


This command sets the read pointer 1 mega-byte before the
current write pointer location and attempts to the use the 
low-level Mark 5 data_check command. The displayed parameters
are the output of is command. A future version will allow the
position of the read pointer to be set explicitly, but this
can be done with a mk5 SNAP command. To check at positon
"pos", use:

mk5=play off pos,data_check?
