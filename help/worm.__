         worm - estimate narrow-track inchworm velocities

Syntax:   worm=stack,scale
          worm

Response: worm/stack,scale,fo,so,fi,si


Settable parameters:
stack     Head stack to measure the speed of, read or 2 (default),
          or write or 1. Only the first character is checked. Only
          write is valid for VLBA. 
scale     Scale to use for speed measurement, update (default) or
          new. Only the first character is checked. The default
          uses the old scale and updates the speed in use.

Monitor-only parameters:
fo        Fast out speed.
so        Slow out speed.
fi        Fast in  speed.
si        Slow in  speed.

Comments: 
This command measures the inchworm speeds. It must be issued once
with parameters to set it up. Issuing the command without
parameters will start a measurement. 

Measurements are made by moving the head stack for 1 second at slow
speeds and 0.1 seconds at fast speeds in each direction. The before
and after voltages are compared and the voltage scale for that head
stack is used to calculate the speed. This scheme works best if the
inchworm starts well away from the limits of its motion.

Either the current (old) or the new voltage scales can be used. The
old scale is the one most recently read on Field System start-up
from the head.ctl control file. The new scale is the most recently
determined scale factor calculated by the hdcalc command.
