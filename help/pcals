PCALS - Set parameters/activate PCALR

Syntax:   PCALS=<#cycles>,<pause>,<repro>,<#blocks>,
          <debug>,<track>, ...
Response: none

Settable parameters:
<#cycles>: number of times to cycle through tracks. 0 = run
           continuously (default).
<pause>: time to pause between cycles, in seconds. Default is 60
         seconds.
<repro>: type of reproduce mode.
        FS = use current mode set up by Field System
        BY = use bypass mode
        RW = use read after write mode
        AB = use split mode (implies bypass mode too)
        If an experiment is in progress (i.e. if a schedule file
        is active) then FS is the recommended mode. Attempts to
        force read-after-write or bypass may result in compromising
        execution of the schedule.
<#blocks>: Number of blocks to average, default 25. The default
           gives 5 degrees rms phase noise or an SNR of 10.
<debug>: 0 for no debug printout (default). A value of +1 prints
         the data buffer status each time it responds. A value of
         +2 will print the actual data and more detailed status
         information. The values -1 and -2 will simply test
         communications with the data buffer and then quit.
<tracks>: tape recorder track(s) to use. 0 = use all tracks for
         current mode (default). A list of track numbers may be
         given. A list of video converters may be specified by
         preceding each number with "V". The words ALL, EVEN, ODD
         referring to tracks and VALL, VEVEN, VODD referring to
         VCs may be used. Split mode will be set up for the outer
         channels in the frequency sequence, if bypass mode is set
         up.

      Comments: This command is identical to PCAL except it sets
up values for PCALR to use with the spectrum analyzer in place of
the data buffer. Invoking this command with no parameters activates
PCALR. To stop PCALR, get a system prompt and "BR,PCALR". Before
starting PCALR, specify LO frequencies with LO command and patching
with PATCH command.

Note: Use of this command is identical to PCAL except that the
fourth parameter specifies integration for the spectrum analyzer
rather than number of blocks of data to average from the data
buffer.
