       fila10g - general FiLa10G communication

            Syntax:     fila10g=data

            Response:   fila10g/data


Settable parameters:
            data        complete message to be sent to FiLa10G system,
                        No checking is done.

Monitor-only parameters:
            data        response of FiLa10G system, if any.

Comments:
This command sends low-level communication messags to the FiLa10G and
presents the response.  The response will span multiple lines
corresponding to the lines sent by the FiLa10G.  The final response
line will be the FiLa10G prompt unles the output exeeeds the internal
buffer limits of the FS (currently 1024 characters).  In the latter
case, as much data as will fit will be presented and an error
reported.

Communication with the FiLa10G is accomplished through the DBBC.
However, the user should not put "fila10g=" at the start of the *data*
field as the command will do this automatically.

See the FiLA10G documentation for a list of FiLa10G commands.
