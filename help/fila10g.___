       fila10g - general FiLa10G communication

            Syntax:     fila10g=data_to
                        fila10g2=data_to

            Response:   fila10g/data_from
                        fila10g2/data_from


Settable parameters:
            data_to     complete message to be sent to FiLa10G system,
                        No checking is done.

Monitor-only parameters:
            data_from   response of FiLa10G system, if any.

Comments:

This command sends low-level communication messages to the FiLa10G and
presents the response.  The response will span multiple lines
corresponding to the lines sent by the FiLa10G.  All lines except the
final one will be labeled with #dbbcn# (#dbbc2# for fila10g2). The
final response line will be the FiLa10G prompt unless the output
exceeds the internal buffer limits of the FS (currently 1024
characters).  In the latter case, as much data as will fit will be
presented and an error reported.

Communication with the FiLa10G is accomplished through the DBBC.
However, the user should not put "fila10g=" at the start of the
*data_to* field as the command will do this automatically.

There are two versions of the command, fila10g and fila10g2. The first
is for communication with a FiLa10G connected to the first, or only,
DBBC2 in a system, which is defined in the dbbad.ctl control file.
This is the DBBC2 used for normal DBBC2 operations.

The second command, fila10g2, is for use in systems with a FiL0a10g
attached to the "second" DBBC2 in a system. The second DBBC2 is
defined in the dbba2.ctl control file. The (limited) FS support for a
second DBBC2 (and FiLa10G) is provided to enable two DBBC2 VGOS
operations.

The fila10g command cannot be used if the rack type in equip.ctl
specifies a DBBC3. Other rack types do not limit the use of this
command.

See the FiLA10G documentation for a list of FiLa10G commands.
