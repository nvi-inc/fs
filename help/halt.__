Syntax:      halt

Response:    none


Comments: 
This command halts execution of the schedule until a cont command is
issued by the operator. Once the current schedule command is finished, no
further commands of any kind will be read from the schedule command
stream while the halt is in effect. Interactive commands from the operator
command stream will still be processed. This is an immediate execution
operator command.
