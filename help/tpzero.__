tpzero - measure zero levels

Syntax:      tpzero=list

Response:    tpzero/zero levels


Settable parameters: 
list           list of modules for which zero levels are to be measured.
               Standard detector mnemonics allowed.

Monitor-only parameters:
zero levels            list of zero levels, counts. These values are stored
                       for use by the tsys1 and tsys2 commands.

Comments: 
These zero levels are subtracted from all readings taken on the same module
before system temperatures are computed. Only USB or LSB readings are
accepted; if another total power selection has been set up with the vc
command, the reading is returned as-1. It is assumed that the IF distributor is
set for maximum attenuation.
