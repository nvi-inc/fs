         wvolt - head write voltage (VLBA, VLBA4 drives)
 
              Syntax:      wvolt=volt1,volt2
 
              Response:    wvolt/volt1,volt2
 
 
 Settable parameters:
              volt1        Write voltage for stack 1. No default.
              volt2        Write voltage for stack 2. No default. For VLBA4
              drives only.
 
 Comments: 
 This command sets and reads the write voltage for heads.
 However it is only for testing purposes. The next rec=load
 will return the write voltage to the values set in the
 vdrive1.ctl or vdrive2.ctl control file.
