FIVEPT - Five or more point source scan

Syntax:   FIVEPT=<axis>,<rep>,<pts>,<stp>,<intp>,<dev>
Response: FIVEPT/<axis>,<rep>,<pts>,<stp>,<intp>,<dev>,
          <cal>,<beam>,<flux>

Settable parameters:
<axis>: Axis system for scan. HADC = Hour Angle/Declination 
                              AZEL = Azimuth/Elevation
                              XYNS = X/Y, +X East
                              XYEW = X/Y, +X South
                                (unimplemented)
                              Default is HADC
<rep>: number of repetitions: -10 to -1 and 1 to 10 allowed. Default is -2.
       Negative repetition counts are described below 
<pts>: number of points on each axis, if even, it is increased by 1,3 <= pts 
       <= 31. Default is 7. 
<Stp>: step size for distance between points, in multiples of a beamwidth.
       Default is 0.5 
<intp>: integration period, 1 to 10 seconds. Default is 1. 
<dev>: device to be used as the detector: VCxx, IFx. The indicated device must
       have been set up. The IFD must be setup and in remote. Default is IF1.

Display-only parameters:
<cal>: calibration noise source temperature in degrees K. This is determined 
       from the last CALTEMP1 and CALTEMP2 commands in conjunction with the 
       PATCH command for the specified device.
<beam>: The full width half maximum beam size degrees. This is determined 
        from the last BEAM1 and BEAM2 commands in conjunction with the 
        PATCH command.
<flux>: The apparent flux of the source. This is determined from the last 
        FLUX1 and FLUX2 commands in conjunction with the PATCH command.

     Comments: The parameters should be setup with a FIVEPT=... command. A 
scan is started by issuing a simple FIVEPT command (i.e. with no parameters),
this will determine the current values of the display only parameters and then
schedule an external program, FIVPT, which then uses the field system to 
perform the necessary measurements. FIVPT must be RP'd before issuing the
command. FIVPT should be included in FSPGM.CTL so that it will automatically 
be RP'd when the Field System is started.

The scan is performed about the current commanded position. Any offsets that 
are in use are included. If the scan is successful the total offsets for the
selected axis type are updated.

It is recommended that nothing else be done, e.g. running a schedule, while 
this command is executing. Since this command may run for an extended period 
of time, a mechanism has been supplied for aborting: enter BR,FIVPT in 
response to a system prompt. The program will then return the antenna to the 
last good offset for each axis. If there was no good offset measurement on an
axis, then the original offset is used.

In order for this command to work, the following conditions must be met: 
(1) the detector device have been setup by the field system, (2) the LO 
command has been issued, (3) the IFD has been setup by the field system and is
in remote, (4) the appropriate BEAMn=... and CALTEMPn=.... must have been 
issued. If a VC is used as the detector then the PATCH command must have been
issued as well. If estimates of performance based on the source flux are 
desired, then the appropriate FLUXn=... command must have been issued as well.
 
Two procedures must be available: CALONFP and CALOFFFP, which are used to turn
the noise diode on and off respectively. The recommended form for these
procedures is:

CALONFP:     CALON
             !+1S 
             SY=GO,FIVPT

CALOFFFP:    CALOFF
             !+1S 
             SY=GO,FIVPT

CALON and CALOFF are local procedures that do whatever is necessary to turn 
the noise source on and off.

The offsets in the longitude-like coordinate (the first coordinate) are 
corrected for the latitude-like coordinate (the second coordinate), 
effectively this causes distances of longitude to be increased by dividing 
them by the cosine of the latitude. Calculated distances are corrected by
multiplying them by the cosine of the latitude-like coordinate so that they
represent distances in beam space.
