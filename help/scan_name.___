                    scan_name - set scan name

            Syntax:     scan_name=name,session,station,length,continuous

            Response:   scan_name/name,session,station,length,continuous


Settable Parameters:
          name      The scan name, any string up to 16 characters in
          length. Typically ddd hhmm, which encodes the day of
          year (ddd), hour (hh), and minute (mm) of the scan.
          If there is more than one subnet in a schedule that
          would have the same scan name otherwise, they are
          distinguished by appending a single alphabetic
          character. All stations in a given subnet use the
          same scan name, which is distinct from that from all
          other subnets.
          session   The session code, any string up to 16 characters
          in length, but is typically six characters or less. May be empty.
          station   The station code, any string up to 16 characters
          in length, but is typically two characters.. May be empty.
          length    The number of seconds in the scan, greater than zero.
          May be empty. 
	  continuous The number of second of continuous recording that
          are scheduled to occur, greater than zero. May be empty.

Comments:
The scan name is used by the correlator to help organize the
processing of the data. It is the most useful way to refer to
scans in e-mail messages and log entries about problems.

The name, session, and station parameters on used by the
disk_record=... command to construct the default scan_label.
 
The scan name is supplied by drudg which places the
scan_name=  command in the schedule before the source= 
command. The scan_name=  command defines the start of each
scan. If a schedule is started in the middle it should be
started at this command for that scan.

When a Mark 5 unit is in use with FS implemented automatic bank
switching (this is the case when the recorder type one in equip.ctl is
"mk5a_bs" or "mk5b_bs"), the length of the scan and the continuous
recording time are used by the FS to decide when to switch banks.  The
length value should always be less than or equal to continuous.  Note
that length refers to number of seconds when "data is valid", while
continuous refers to the number of seconds of recording.  If
continuous is omitted, the length is assumed to also represent the
recording time. For continuous recording scans after the the initial
scan, the continuous recording time refers to the time from the
previous data_valid=off until the end of recording. Note that even if
a Mark 5 unit is selected in equip.ctl, but if the schedule was
DRUDG'd with the recorder as "none" (e.g., for eVLBI), the schedule
will contain no recorder commands, so there will be no recorder use or
bank switching.  See the bank_check command for further details on
automatic bank switching.
