                    scan_name - set scan name

            Syntax:     scan_name=name,session,length

            Response:   scan_name/name,session,length


Settable Parameters:
          name      The scan name, any string up to 16 characters in
          length. Typically ddd hhmm, which encodes the day of
          year (ddd), hour (hh), and minute (mm) of the scan.
          If there is more than one subnet in a schedule that
          would have the same scan name otherwise, they are
          distinguished by appending a single alphabetic
          character. All stations in a given subnet use the
          same scan name, which is distinct from that from all
          other subnets.
          session   The session code, any string up to 16 characters
          in length. May be empty.
          length    The number of seconds in the scan, greater than zero.
          May be empty. 

Comments:
The scan name is used by the correlator to help organize the
processing of the data. It is the most useful way to refer to
scans in e-mail messages and log entries about problems.
 
The scan name is supplied by drudg which places the
scan_name=  command in the schedule before the source= 
command. The scan_name=  command defines the start of each
scan. If a schedule is started in the middle it should be
started at this command for that scan.
