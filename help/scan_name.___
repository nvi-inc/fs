                    scan_name - set scan name

Syntax:     scan_name=name

Response:   scan_name/name


Settable Parameters:
name      The scan name, any string up to 16 characters in
          length. Typically ddd hhmm, which encodes the day of
          year (ddd), hour (hh), and minute (mm) of the scan. If
          there is more than one subnet in a schedule that would
          have the same scan name otherwise, they are
          distinguished by appending a single alphabetic
          character. All stations in a given subnet use the same
          scan name, which is distinct from that from all other
          subnets.

Comments:
The scan name is used by the correlator to help organize the
processing of the data. It is the most useful way to refer to
scans in e-mail messages and log entries about problems.
 
The scan name is supplied by drudg which places the scan_name= 
command in the schedule before the source=  command. The
scan_name=  command defines the start of each scan. If a
schedule is started in the middle it should be started at this
command for that scan.
