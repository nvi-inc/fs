                    scan_name - set scan name

            Syntax:     scan_name=name,session,station,length,continuous

            Response:   scan_name/name,session,station,length,continuous


Settable Parameters:
          name      The scan name, any string up to 16 characters in
          length. Typically ddd hhmm, which encodes the day of
          year (ddd), hour (hh), and minute (mm) of the scan.
          If there is more than one subnet in a schedule that
          would have the same scan name otherwise, they are
          distinguished by appending a single alphabetic
          character. All stations in a given subnet use the
          same scan name, which is distinct from that from all
          other subnets.
          session   The session code, any string up to 16 characters
          in length, but is typically six characters or less. May be empty.
          station   The station code, any string up to 16 characters
          in length, but is typically two characters.. May be empty.
          length    The number of seconds in the scan, greater than zero.
          May be empty. 
	  continuous The number of second of continuous recording that
          are scheduled to occur, greater than zero. May be empty.

Comments:
The scan name is used by the correlator to help organize the
processing of the data. It is the most useful way to refer to
scans in e-mail messages and log entries about problems.

The name, session, and station parameters on used by the
disk_record=... command to construct the default scan_label.
 
The scan name is supplied by drudg which places the
scan_name=  command in the schedule before the source= 
command. The scan_name=  command defines the start of each
scan. If a schedule is started in the middle it should be
started at this command for that scan.

When a Mark 5A unit is in use with FS implemented automatic bank
switching (this is the case for all piggyback operations and when the
recorder type one in equip.ctl is "mk5a_bs").  The length of the scan
and the continuous recording time are used by the FS to decide when to
switch banks.  The length value should always be less than or equal to
continuous.  Note that length refers to number of seconds when "data
is valid", while continuous refers to the number of seconds of
recording.  If continuous is omitted, the length is assumed to also
represent the recording time. See the bank_check command for further
details.
