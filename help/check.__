check - modules to be checked
Syntax:      check=list

Response:    check/list


Settable parameters:
list    The list of mnemonics for modules to be checked. Only
        mnemonics for the equipment identified in the equip.ctl
        control file are valid in this command. Standard module
        mnemonics are allowed. If the list of modules to be
        checked is empty, then chekr will not check any modules.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
As modules are set up by SNAP commands, they are automatically
added to the list of modules being checked by chekr. This
command can be used to remove and reinstate modules on the list.

The entire list of modules to be checked may always be specified
by listing the appropriate modules. However, the list of modules
already being checked may also be modified by entering * as the
first parameter, followed by the list of modules to be added or
deleted from the existing list. Deletion is indicated by a leading
minus sign. For example,

                       check=*,ifd,-tp

will cause the IF distributor to be added to the list of modules
being checked and the tape transport to be removed from the list,
while the check status of all other modules remain unchanged.

If no modules are currently being checked then the word
disabled is displayed.

The displayed list of modules always consists of the standard 2-
character mnemonic, i.e. the ones listed on the reference page at
the front of this manual.

Note: for VLBA systems, only the head positioner is checked in
the current version.
