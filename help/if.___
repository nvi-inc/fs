		      if - conditional execution

            Syntax:     if=condition,true-command,false-command

            Response:   none


Settable parameters:
          condition     condition to test, see list in comments, case
                        insensitive, leading and trailing spaces are trimmed,
                        no default
          true-command  SNAP command to execute if condition is true,
                        leading spaces are trimmed, default is null
          false-command SNAP command to execute if condition is false,
                        leading spaces are trimmed, default is null

Comments:
The backslash '\' characater can be used to escape any character
before the end of the command. This is particularly useful for commas
',' and at signs '@' used in the true-command or false-command.

This command provides conditional execution of SNAP commands based on
whether a "condition" true or false.  If the value of the condition is
true, the "true-command" is executed; if false, the "false-command".
If the command that would be eexecuted, the "if" command is
essentially a no-op. The available conditions and their values given
in the following table.

 true      always true
 false     always false
 ddc       true iff DDC personality is in use
 pfb       true iff PFB personality is in use

 core1     true iff any channels from core1 are selected for recording 
 core2     true iff any channels from core2 are selected for recording 
 core3     true iff any channels from core3 are selected for recording 
 core4     true iff any channels from core1 are selected for recording
 ifa       true iff any channels from ifa are selected for recording
 ifb       true iff any channels from ifb are selected for recording
 ifc       true iff any channels from ifc are selected for recording
 ifd       true iff any channels from ifd are selected for recording
