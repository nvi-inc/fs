        tapepos - position tape (Mark III, Mark IV drives)
 
              Syntax:      tapepos=footage
 
              Response:    tapepos/footage
 
 
 Settable parameters:
            footage    The actual tape footage (as read on the counter) at
            which to position the tape.
 
 Comments: 
 This command starts the tape moving at fast forward or reverse
 speed (via an immediate ff or rw command) and time-schedules
 an et command such that the tape will coast to a stop at the
 requested footage count (approximately). If the request is
 less than 100 feet off, then nothing is done. The model used
 is:
 
                   dt = tacc*0.01 + dfeet/22.5
 
 where 
          dt       time between the ff or rw command and the et command
            dfeet      number of feet to move
          tacc     a parameter which accounts for acceleration and
          deceleration. The nominal value for tacc is 100, and
          is taken from the drivem1.ctl or drivem2.ctl file,
          depending on which drive is in use.
 
 The correct value of tacc can be measured on an unloaded
 computer by issuing a tapepos=... command to position the
 tape. If the drive overshoots the command footage by efeet
 (negative for undershoot), the corrected value for tacc,
 rounded to the nearest integer, is:
 
                 taccnew = taccold - efeet/0.225
 
 Tape drives that will not position consistently within a few
 feet may require adjustment.
 
 For VLBA recorders, use the rec command.
