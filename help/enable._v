            enable - enable record tracks (VLBA drive)

Syntax:     enable=list-of-groups

Response:   enable/list-of-groups


Settable parameters:
list-of-groups  List of track groups to be enabled/disabled. Groups are
                specified by gn, n=0 to 3. A null list (i.e. enable=)
                disables all tracks. For mode D, a single track to be
                recorded may be indicated by setting list-of-groups to dn,
                n = 1 to 28. The group within which Mark III track n
                occurs will be enabled.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The use of * as a parameter is not supported by this command.

This command enables groups of tracks in the VLBA recorder. Tracks
may not be individually enabled. The form command sets up the track
assignments with the cross-point switch. In mode D, an entire group
of tracks is enabled. The VLBA form command must be used to specify
which track so that only that track has data going to it. It is not
possible to record in mode D for a Mark III rack/VLBA drive
combination.
