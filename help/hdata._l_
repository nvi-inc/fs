 Comments: 
 MAT module functions available for Mark III/IV. No MCB
 functions available for VLBA/4.  See section 1.0 of this
 manual.
 
 This command reads the head positioner A/D channels, all
 values are reported in units of volts. Data from all channels
 are reported regardless of whether anything is hooked up to
 them or not. In particular, most stations do not use the
 temperature channels, the vacuum sensor, and normally only one
 of the reproduce power channels is hooked up.
 
 The position voltages (and all others) are reported with the
 LVDT off. Use the lvdt command to measure positions with the
 LVDT on.
 
 All parameters except oddpwr and evpwr are null if the drive
 type specified in the equip.ctl control file is vlba2.
