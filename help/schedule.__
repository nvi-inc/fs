schedule - start a new schedule file
Syntax:      schedule=name,start,#lines

Response:    schedule/name,line


Settable parameters:
name            name of schedule file to be started. If no
                directory path is specified, /usr2/sched assumed.
                If no extension is specified, .snp is assumed.
                Any currently-executing schedule file is closed,
                and the new schedule file is opened. If the new
                file cannot be opened, there will be no schedule
                active. When a valid schedule is started, a cont
                command may be necessary.
start           place in the schedule to begin executing. May be
                one of the following:
                      null to start with the observation
                      beginning no earlier than 5 minutes from
                      now.
                      #line for a line number in the file,
                      should be a source command.
                      time to start with the observation
                      beginning no earlier than this time. time
                      is in standard SNAP format.
#lines             number of lines to execute before
                   automatically halting. Default is the remainder
                   of the schedule.

Monitor-only parameters:
line            the line number to be executed next.

Comments: 
If the schedule is started successfully, a log file having the same
name as the schedule is automatically started, and the procedure
file having the same name as the schedule is automatically
established as the schedule procedure library. Any previously
time-scheduled procedures from this library are cancelled. If a #
of lines is specified, an automatic halt will be issued after
execution of these lines. The schedule may then be continued using
the cont command.

Note: If the schedule file is larger than 100,000 lines, execution
will halt after 100,000 lines.
