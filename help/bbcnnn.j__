          bbcnn - digital baseband converter (DBBC3 racks)

            Syntax:     bbcnn=freq,IF,bw,tpint
            Response:   bbcnn/freq,IF,bw,tpint,gainctrl,gainU,gainL,tpUcalon,tpLcalon,tpUcaloff,tpLcaloff

            nn is the BBC index number corresponding to its order in
            position in the DBBC rack, 01 to 64.

Settable Parameters:

            freq      L.O. frequency in MHz, between 0-4096.000000,
                      inclusive.  This frequency may be specified to 1
                      Hz resolution, i.e., 6 places after the decimal
                      point.

            IF        I.F. input source, one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
                      Defaults:  Converters   IF
                                   01-08       A
                                   09-16       B
                                   17-24       C
                                   25-32       D
                                   33-40       E
                                   41-48       F
                                   49-56       G
                                   57-64       H

                      This parameter does not affect equipment set-up,
                      it is for informaton only.

            bw        Sideband bandwidth in MHz. One of 2, 4, 8, 16,
                      32, 64, or 128.  Default 32. For monitor, a
                      value of 0 maybe displayed if the BBC has not
                      been configured.

            tpint     Averaging period in seconds for TPI. Positive
                      integers 1-60 allowed, Default is 1. The averaging
                      period is common to both upper and lower
                      sideband. The averaging period is synchronous
                      with the 1 pps.

Monitor-only Parameters:

             gainctrl  Gain control mode, either agc or man. The gain
                       mode is common to both sidebands.

             gainU     Gain value for USB in steps, 0-255.
             gainL     Gain value for LSB in steps, 0-255.

             tpUcalon  Power in upper sideband in counts with the cal
                       on for synchronous radiometry or TP for
                       non-synchronous. Range 0 to 65535.  See the
                       comments for information about the nominal
                       operating level.

             tpLcalon  Power in lower sideband in counts with the cal
                       on for synchronous radiometry or TP for
                       non-synchronous. Range 0 to 65535.  See the
                       comments for information about the nominal
                       operating level.

             tpUcaloff Power in upper sideband in counts with the cal
                       off for synchronous radiometry or 0 for
                       non-synchronous. Range 0 to 65535.   See the
                       comments for information about the nominal
                       operating level.

             tpLcaloff Power in lower sideband in counts with the cal
                       off for synchronous radiometry or 0 for
                       non-synchronous. Range 0 to 65535.   See the
                       comments for information about the nominal
                       operating level.

Comments:
This command sets up the digital channel converters in the DBBC3 rack.
This command is analogous to the Mark IV VCnn and VLBA BBCnn commands.

Unlike the output of most other commands which have no embedded
blanks, the output for this command is organized in columns so when
multiple comands are used in sequence it is easy to read gains and
power levels.

The IF selection parameter is provided for information only. CAUTION:
This command does not check whether you have specified a valid IF
source for the channel.

gainU and gainL can be controlled with the bbc_gain command

The nominal operating level for TP counts depends on the configuration
of the system.  The level is set by the BBC_GAIN command, typically
16000 in AGC mode.
