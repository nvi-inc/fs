                   tpzero - measure zero levels

            Syntax:     tpzero=list

            Response:   tpzero/zero levels


Settable parameters: 
            list        List of modules for which zero levels are to be
            measured. Standard detector mnemonics allowed.

Monitor-only parameters:
            zero levels List of zero levels, counts. These values are stored
            for use by the tsys/5/6.

Comments: 
Except for station defined detectors, the results are returned
grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value, the output is
collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have no IF
assigned are displayed first followed by Ifs 1-3 (Mark III/IV)
and a-d (VLBA/4). If the output for an IF would make a long
output line, the output is split into more than one line. For
station defined detectors the results are just displayed in
order: u5, u6.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark
III/IV, LBA, or VLBA/4 detector will not prevent results from
other detectors from being displayed.  A negative integer will
be shown for each channel that had an error that prevented an
actual measurement from being displayed. An overflow value,
65535, is displayed as dollar signs, $$$$$.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the
VCs are displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s
is for the detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u
(upper), l (lower), or a digit 4-7 for other detectors.

It is assumed the noise calibration signal is off and
attenuations is at a maximum or the signal is somehow turn-
off.

These zero levels are subtracted from all readings taken on
the same module before system temperatures are computed in the
TSYS command.

This command is not used for LBA racks as the digital nature
of their detectors ensures this value is always zero.  Any
values measured this way will be ignored.
