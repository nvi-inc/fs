                   tpzero - measure zero levels

            Syntax:     tpzero=list

            Response:   tpzero/zero levels


Settable parameters:
 
            list         List of modules for which zero levels are to
                         be measured.  Standard detector mnemonics
                         allowed.  In addition: for VLBA/4/5/DBBC
                         'formif' and 'formbbc' are permitted; for
                         Mark III/IV/5, 'formif' and 'formvc' are
                         permitted; station detectors 'u5' and 'u6'
                         are permitted.

Monitor-only parameters:

            zero levels  List of detector & zero level pairs.  Zero
                         levels are in counts.  These values are
                         stored for use by the 'tsys' command.

Comments: 

The results are returned grouped in pairs of 'mnemonic,value' per
device.  The output is collected into lines by IF channel.  Detectors
that have no IF assigned are displayed first followed by those for IFs
'1'-'3' (Mark III/IV) and 'a'-'d' (VLBA/4/5/DBBC).  If the output for
an IF would make a long output line, the output is split into more
than one line.  For station detectors, the values are displayed on one
line.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the VCs are
displayed as 'hs', where 'h' is the VC number as hex and 's' is for
the sideband: 'd' (dual for upper/lower), 'u' (upper), 'l' (lower), a
digit '3'-'7' for other VC detectors or 'x' for unknown.

For VLBA/4/5/DBBC, additional mnemonics 'formif' and 'formbbc' are
permitted in the 'list'.  These select the detectors for the IF
channels and BBC sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter.
For Mark III/IV/5, 'formvc' is accepted instead of 'formbbc', as well
as 'formif'.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark III/IV, LBA,
or VLBA/4/5/DBBC detector will not prevent results from other
detectors from being displayed.  A negative integer will be shown for
each channel that had an error that prevented an actual measurement
from being reported.  An overflow value, 65535, is displayed as dollar
signs, '$$$$$'.

It is assumed the noise calibration signal is off and the attenuation
is at a maximum or the signal is somehow turned-off.

Except as noted below, these zero levels are subtracted from all
readings taken on the same module before system temperatures are
computed in the 'tsys' command.

This command is not used for LBA or DBBC racks as the digital nature
of their detectors ensures this value is always (or nearly) zero.  Any
values measured for these racks will be ignored.  The 'tpzero' command
should be omitted for these racks.

For station detectors, if the 'zero' parameter in the 'user_device'
command is set to 'no', the value from 'tpzero' is ignored by the
'tsys' command, even if it was measured.  The use of 'tpzero' should
be omitted in this case.
