                   tpzero - measure zero levels
 
              Syntax:      tpzero=list
 
              Response:    tpzero/zero levels
 
 
 Settable parameters: 
            list       List of modules for which zero levels are to be
            measured. Standard detector mnemonics allowed.
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
              zero levels  List of zero levels, counts. These values are
              stored for use by the tsys1/2/3 and tsysa/b/c/d
              commands.
 
 Comments: 
 These zero levels are subtracted from all readings taken on
 the same module before system temperatures are computed. 
 
 For Mark III/IV racks, only USB or LSB readings are accepted;
 if another total power selection has been set up with the vc
 command, the reading is returned as -1. It is assumed that the
 IF distributor is set for maximum attenuation.
 
 For Mark III/IV racks, the readings are listed from the
 selected detectors in the order: VC01-VC14, IF1, IF2, IF3. For
 VLBA racks, the readings are listed from the selected
 detectors in the order: Lower Side Band: BBC01-BBC14, Upper
 Side Band: BBC01-BBC14, IFA, IFB, IFC, IFD.
