            cablelong - get the cable cal long reading
 
 Syntax:      cablelong=message
 
 Response:    cablelong/value
 
 
 Settable parameters:
 message      ASCII character to be sent to counter.
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
 value        cable cal long reading
 
 Comments: 
 When issued with no parameters this command sends a request for
 a reading to the HPIB counter which is connected to the phase
 cal cable measurement system.
 
 The cablelong command is identical to the cable command. It is
 intended to be used for the "long" cable measurement when
 checking the sign of the cable counter before and after an
 experiment. If cablelong is used for the measurements, auto-
 scaled plots of the cable/ output will have reasonable
 resolution. It also provides a "long" cable measurement for
 cablediff to use to calculate the change and sign.
 
 The ibad.ctl control file must contain an entry with mnemonic CA
 and the device name.
 
 If your counter returns a non-standard response, you can control
 the parsing of the response by placing the uncommented line
 below in your stcmd.ctl file:
 
 *command     seg sbpa bo eq
 cablelong    qkr 76xx 01 FFFFFF
 
 where xx is the number of the character position to begin
 decoding at. The first character position is counted as position
 1. If the value of xx is 00 decoding will begin after the
 rightmost non-numeric character (including "E" for exponent in
 scientific notation). The FS uses a value of 04 for xx by
 default.
