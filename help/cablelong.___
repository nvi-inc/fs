            cablelong - get the cable cal long reading

            Syntax:     cablelong=message

            Response:   cablelong/value


Settable parameters:
            message     ASCII character to be sent to counter.

Monitor-only parameters:
            value       cable cal long reading

Comments: 
When issued with no parameters this command sends a request
for a reading to the HPIB counter which is connected to the
phase cal cable measurement system.

The cablelong command is identical to the cable command. It is
intended to be used for the "long" cable measurement when
checking the sign of the cable counter before and after an
experiment. If cablelong is used for the measurements, auto-
scaled plots of the cable/ output will have reasonable
resolution. It also provides a "long" cable measurement for
cablediff to use to calculate the change and sign.

The ibad.ctl control file must contain an entry with mnemonic
CA and the device name.

If your counter returns a non-standard response, you can
control the parsing of the response by placing the uncommented
line below in your stcmd.ctl file:

*command     seg sbpa bo eq
cablelong    qkr 76xx 01 FFFFFFFFF

where xx is the number of the character position to begin
decoding at. The first character position is counted as
position 1. If the value of xx is 00 decoding will begin at
the first character from the left that could be part of a
number in scientific notation ("0123456789.+-Ee").  The FS
uses a value of 04 for xx by default.
