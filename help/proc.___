            proc - open new "schedule" procedure library

            Syntax:     proc=name

            Response:   proc/name


Settable parameters:

          name      name of procedure library to open.  The file for
                    the library must be in '/usr2/proc/' and end with
                    a '.prc' extension.  The maximum length of 'name'
                    is 18 characters.  Spaces are not allowed.  The
                    library is opened as the "schedule" library, and
                    all procedure names are read.  If 'name' is null,
                    i.e., empty, any open schedule library is closed.

                    If no schedule library is open, the 'name' in the
                    response is null.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments:
Unlike the schedule 'name' in the 'schedule=...' command, if the
procedure library 'name' in this command can't be opened, an already
open one will stay open.

You can specify a name of an actual library as 'none'. However, this
can be confusing.

When a new procedure library is opened, any time-scheduled procedures
from the previous "schedule" procedure library are canceled.  See
section 8.0 of the SNAP Language manual for details.

There is an interlock that causes a 'proc=...' command to be rejected
if 'pfmed' is running.  The problem can be rectified by exiting
'pfmed'.  Refer to the 'pfmed' manual for information on editing
procedure libraries.

Please see the comments section of the 'help' page for the 'schedule'
command for information on how the "schedule" and "station" procedures
interact.
