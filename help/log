LOG - Start a new log file

Syntax:   LOG=<name>
Response: LOG/<name>

Settable parameters:
<name>: name of log file to be opened. If no directory path is
        specified, /LOG is assumed. If no extension is specified,
        .LOG is assumed.

Monitor-only parameters: none

      Comments: When the Field System is initialized, log file
STATION.LOG was opened or created in directory /LOG. If the log
file requested by this command cannot be opened or created, the
Field System returns to using the log file previously in use. If
no log file can be successfully opened, execution of the schedule
continues, but an error message is displayed on the screen every
time an attempt is made to write into the log.
