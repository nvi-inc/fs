  tpicd - tpicd daemon control (LBA4, Mark III/IV, VLBA, VLBA4, DBBC, RDBE, DBBC3 racks)

            Syntax:     tpicd=cont,cycle
                        tpicd
                        tpicd=stop

            Response:   tpicd/cont,cycle
                        tpicd/detector list


Settable parameters:
              cont          Whether to sample continuously or not: no
                            (default) or yes. If no, sampling is stopped and
                            started by the data_valid=...  command.
              cycle         Number of centiseconds per cycle, 0 disables
                            sampling.

Monitor-only parameters:
              detector list   List of detectors to be sampled, grouped by IF
                              channel as in the tpi, tpical, tpzero, tpgain,and
                              tsys commands. The list is constructed from the
                              VCs selected by the formatter and the IFs that
                              feed them when the tpicd=... command is issued. 

Comments: The form "tpicd" is used to start the extraction. The form
"tpicd=stop" is used to halt it. The form "tpicd=?" returns the
current set-up information.

If the 'cont' parameter is 'no', then 'tpicd' is being controlled
by the 'data_valid' command. If 'data_valid' is 'on', it will record
data. It begins and stops sampling and recording data within one
second of a request to do so. In other words within one second of the
execution of a "data_valid=..."  command.  In this mode no data is
logged if a schedule is not active or if the schedule is halted; this
feature is to prevent "run-away" logging if the schedule is closed or
halted while 'data_valid' is 'on'.

The form "tpicd=tsys" can be used only if continuous cal is
selected. It will cause the tsys to be calculated from the next set of
samples (not yet supported for RDBEs).  The number of samples is
specified by the cont_cal command.  This does not disturb the behavior
otherwise.

This command controls the tpicd TPI measurement daemon.  The remaining
comments describe the daemon.

The daemon measures the TPI values (Mark III/IV, LBA4, and DBBC racks)
and BBC channels gains and IF channel TPI values (VLBA/4 racks).  For
Mark III/IV, LBA4, and DBBC racks the values appear in the log as
"#tpicd#tpi/" entries.  For VLBA/4 racks the values appear in the log
as "#tpicd#tpgain/" entries.  IF TPI values for the VLBA/4 racks are
reported in the tpgain records even though they are not gains.  If
there is a continuous calibration system (cont_cal=on,...), the raw
values are reported in "#tpicd#tpcont/" entries and the derived Tsys
values are reported in "#tpicd#tsys/" entires every time the number of
samples as specified by the cont_cal command has been collected (these
Tsys values are only informational and are used internally by the FS
for display of Tsys).  None of these are normally displayed to the
operator; they only go in the log.

There are two exceptions to the tpicd output log entries not being
displayed to the operator.  The first is that if the command
"tpicd=display_on" is given, the entries will be displayed until there
a "tpicd=display_off" command is given.  The second is that continuous
calibration is in use, and the "tpicd=tsys" command is given, then
averaged tpi, averaged tpical, noise diode temperatures, and derived
tsys are all displayed (and logged), respectively, as "tpi/" and
"tpical/", "caltemps/", and "tsys/" records (in all cases without
"#tpicd#" appended). For IF channels, data is included only in the
average "tpi/" records, even though the values are not strictly TPI.

The tpicd daemon results the raw and derived results are returned
grouped in pairs of:

    detector mnemonic, value

For #tpicd#tpcont/ they are triples:

   detector mnemonic, tpi, tpical

(except for IF detectors which don't have tpical values).

The output is collected into lines by IF channel.  Detectors that have
no IF assigned are displayed first followed by IFs 1-3 (Mark III/IV or
LBA4), 1-4 (LBA), and a-d (VLBA/4, DBBC). If the output for an IF
would make a long output line, the output is split into more than one
line.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark III/IV, LBA,
VLBA/4, or DBBC detector will not prevent results from other detectors
from being displayed.  A negative integer will be shown for each
channel that had an error that prevented an actual measurement from
being displayed. An overflow value, 65535, is displayed as dollar
signs, $$$$$, (for gains an overflow is 255).

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the VCs are
displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s is for the
detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u (upper), l (lower), a
digit 3-7 for other detectors or 'x' for unknown.
