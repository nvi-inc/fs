            Response:   tpicd/cont,cycle
                        tpicd/detector list


Settable parameters:
              cont          Whether to sample continuously or not: 'no'
                            (default) or 'yes'. If 'no', sampling is stopped and
                            started by the 'data_valid=...'  command.
              cycle         Number of centiseconds per cycle, '0' disables
                            sampling.

Monitor-only parameters:
              detector list   List of detectors to be sampled, grouped by IF
                              channel. The list is constructed from the
                              VCs/BBC selected by the formatter and the IFs that
                              feed them when the 'tpicd=cont,cycle' command is
                              issued (except for RDBEs, for which all
                              detectors are included).

Comments:
The form 'tpicd' is used to start the TPI recording. The form
'tpicd=stop' is used to halt it.

To configure 'tpicd', the following sequence should be used:

  tpicd=stop
  tpicd=cont,cycle
  tpicd

In other words: stop it, configure it, and restart it.

The form 'tpicd=?' returns the current set-up information.

If the 'cont' parameter is 'no', then 'tpicd' is being controlled
by the 'data_valid' command. If 'data_valid' is 'on', it will record
data. It begins and stops sampling and recording data within one
second of a request to do so. In other words, within one second of the
execution of a 'data_valid=...'  command.  In this mode no data is
logged if a schedule is not active or if the schedule is halted; this
feature is to prevent "run-away" logging if the schedule is closed or
halted while 'data_valid' is 'on'.

The form 'tpicd=tsys' can be used only if continuous cal is selected.
It will cause the Tsys to be calculated from the next set of samples and
displayed (not yet supported for RDBEs).The number of samples is
specified by the 'cont_cal' command.  This does not disturb the behavior
otherwise.

The log output is not normally displayed. The 'tpicd=display_on' form
will cause all output to be displayed until the 'tpicd=display_off' form
is used.

The form 'tpicd=reset' can only be used with a DBBC3 and only if
continuous cal is selected. If averaging has been selected, this form
will force a reset of the detector averages. This is useful, e.g., if
RFI had caused the averages to be skewed.

For DBBC3s, this command controls the 'dbtcn' daemon, which collects and
process multicast data. The details of that functional is described more
fully in the "FS DBBC3 Operations Manual".

For RDBEs, this command controls the 'rdtcn' daemons, which collect and
process multicast data. The details of that functional is described more
fully in the "FS RDBE Support" manual.

The remainder of this "Comments" section describes the daemon for rack
types other than RDBEs and DBBC3s.

The daemon samples the TPI values (Mark III/IV/5, LBA4, and DBBC racks)
and BBC channels gains and IF channel TPI values (VLBA/4/5 racks).  For
Mark III/IV/5, LBA4, and DBBC racks the values appear in the log as
'#tpicd#tpi/' entries.  For VLBA/4/5 racks the values appear in the log
as '#tpicd#tpgain/' entries.  IF TPI values for the VLBA/4/5 racks are
reported in the 'tpgain' records even though they are not gains.  If
there is a continuous calibration system ('cont_cal=on,...'), the raw
values are reported in '#tpicd#tpcont/' entries and the derived Tsys
values are reported in '#tpicd#tsys/' entires every time the number of
samples as specified by the 'cont_cal' command has been collected (these
Tsys values are only informational and are used internally by the FS for
display of Tsys).

For racks other than RDBEs and DBBC32, the 'tpicd=tsys' form will
display, in addition to Tsys, averaged TPI, averaged TPIcal, noise diode
temperatures, respectively, as 'tsys/', 'tpi/' and 'tpical/',
'caltemps/'. For VLBA/4/5 and DBBC2 IF channels, raw data is included
only in the average 'tpi/' records. For DBBC2s these values are not
strictly speaking TPI values.

The 'tpicd 'daemon results the raw and derived results are returned
grouped in pairs of:

    detector mnemonic, value

For '#tpicd#tpcont/' they are triples:

   detector mnemonic, tpi, tpical

(except for VLBA/4/5 and DBBC2 IF detectors which don't have TPIcal
values).

The output is collected into lines by IF channel.  Detectors that have
no IF assigned are displayed first followed by IFs 1-3 (Mark III/IV/5 or
LBA4), 1-4 (LBA), and a-d (VLBA/4/5, DBBC2). If the output for an IF
would make a long output line, the output is split into more than one
line.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark III/IV/5, LBA,
VLBA/4/5, or DBBC2 detector will not prevent results from other
detectors from being recorded.  A negative integer will be shown for
each channel that had an error that prevented an actual sample from
being displayed. A TPI overflow value, 65535, is displayed as dollar
signs, '$$$$$' (for gains an overflow is '255').

For Mark III/IV/5 and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the VCs are
displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s is for the
detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u (upper), l (lower), a
digit 3-7 for other detectors or 'x' for unknown.
