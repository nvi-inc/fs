          tpical - read total power integrators, cal on

            Syntax:     tpical=list

            Response:   tpical/readings


Settable parameters:
            list        List of total power integrators to be read back.
            Standard detector mnemonics allowed.

Monitor-only parameters:
            readings    List of readings, counts. These values are stored
            for use by the tsys/5/6 commands.

Comments: 
Except for station defined detectors, the results are returned
grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value, the output is
collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have no IF
assigned are displayed first followed by IFs 1-3 (Mark III/IV
or LBA4), 1-4 (LBA) and a-d (VLBA/4). If the output for an IF
would make a long output line, the output is split into more
than one line. For station defined detectors the results are
just displayed in order: u5, u6.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark
III/IV or VLBA/4 detector will not prevent results from other
detectors from being displayed.  A negative integer will be
shown for each channel that had an error that prevented an
actual measurement from being displayed. An overflow value,
65535, is displayed as dollar signs, $$$$$.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the
VCs are displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s
is for the detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u
(upper), l (lower), or a digit 4-7 for other detectors.

It is assumed the noise calibration signal is on.
