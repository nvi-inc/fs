Settable parameters:
            list        List of total power integrators to be read back.
                        Standard detector mnemonics allowed.  In
                        addition for VLBA/4/5 formif and formbbc are
                        permitted, for Mark III/IV/5, formif and
                        formvc are permitted.


Monitor-only parameters:
            readings    List of readings, counts. These values are stored
                        for use by the tsys/5/6 commands.

Comments: 

The results are returned grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value,
the output is collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have
no IF assigned are displayed first followed by IFs 1-3 (Mark III/IV or
LBA4), 1-4 (LBA) and a-d (VLBA/4). If the output for an IF would make
a long output line, the output is split into more than one line.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark III/IV or
VLBA/4 detector will not prevent results from other detectors from
being displayed.  A negative integer will be shown for each channel
that had an error that prevented an actual measurement from being
displayed. An overflow value, 65535, is displayed as dollar signs,
$$$$$.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the VCs are
displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s is for the
detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u (upper), l (lower), a
digit 3-7 for other detectors or 'x' for unknown.

For VLBA/4/5, additional mnemonics formif and formbbcc are permitted
in the list.  These select the detectors for the IF channels and BBC
sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter.  For Mark
III/IV/5, formvc is accepted instead of formbbc, as well as formif.

It is assumed the noise calibration signal is on.
