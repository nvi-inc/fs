          perr - sample parity errors (Mark III drives)

            Syntax:     perr=track,chan,#samples,period,mode

            Response:   perr/track,chan,#samples,period,mode,error,synerr


Settable parameters:
          track     Track to be decoded. No default.
          chan      Decoder channel A (default) or B.
            #samples    Number of samples to average, maximum 10, default
            2.
            period      Time between samples in seconds, maximum 2, default
            0.5.
          mode      rec or play, default rec.

Monitor-only parameters:
            error       Average number of parity errors.
            synerr      Total number of sync errors.

Comments: 
This command sets up the appropriate track for reproduce, and
then reads the decoder one more than the specified number of
times with the specified amount of time between samples.
Differences between successive readings are averaged to
calculate error. The difference between the first and last
synch error readings is synerr. In rec mode, track must be
enabled, the tape must be moving forward, record must be
enabled, and reproduce must be in read-after-write mode. In
play mode, only read-after-write and moving tape are checked.
In either mode, if the measurement of parity errors is
precluded by the tape status, then nothing is done and no
error message appears. (See also parity command.)

This command requires a Mark III decoder.
