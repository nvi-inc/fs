TAPEPOS - Position tape

Syntax:   TAPEPOS=<footage>
Response: TAPEPOS/<footage>

Settable parameters:
<footage>: The actual tape footage (as read on the counter) at
           which to position the tape.

      Comments: This command starts the tape moving at fast forward
or reverse speed (via an immediate FF or RW command) and
time-schedules an ET command such that the tape will coast to a
stop at the requested footage count (approximately). If the request
is less than 100 feet off, then nothing is done. The model used is:

             dt = tacc*0.01 + dfeet/22.5

where dt=time between the FF or RW command and the ET command,
dfeet=number of feet to move, and tacc is a parameter which
accounts for acceleration and deceleration. The nominal value for
tacc is 100, and is taken from the LOCATION.CTL file.

The correct value of tacc can be measured on an unloaded computer
by issuing a TAPEPOS=... command to position the tape. If the drive
overshoots the command footage by efeet (negative for undershoot).
The corrected value for tacc, rounded to the nearest integer, is:

               tacc(new) = tacc(old) - efeet/0.225

Tape dives which will not position consistently within a few feet
may require adjustment.
