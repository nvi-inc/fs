mcast_time - display time information from multicast time (DBBC3 rack)

Syntax:   mcast_time

Response: mcast_time/0,last,age,hsecs
          mcast_time/board,time,epoch,pps2dot,offset

Settable parameters:

None.

Monitor only parameter:
0           Literal '0', indicates this is the output line for the
            Time of last multicast received
last        Time the most recent multicast message was received
age         Number of seconds since the last message was received
hsecs       The centiseconds of the FS time when the multicast
            message was received.

board       Core3H board number, 1-8, for this output line
time        Core3H multicast time
epoch       Reported VDIF epoch in use, currently null.
pps2dot     Core3H pps_delay value, seconds
offset      Difference between 'time' for this board and 'last',
            positive board if the board time is later

Comments:

This command displays the Core3H board time information from the
most recently received multicast message.

The 'time' for a board may be up to one second earlier than the
time of the log entry, depending in when the command is executed.

The values for 'time' and 'last' should agree since the latter is
the second that the multicast was received.

The format of 'time' and 'last' is:

   yyyy.ddd.hh:mm:ss

The lines output for the boards are columnized for readability.

The hsecs fields can be useful as a measure of the delay of the
multicast if the FS is running on NTP. It should agree roughly with
the multicast delay in the dbbc3.ctl control file.

The VDIF epoch is currently not provided by the multicast, but it is
expected that it will be added.

The output for firmware v124 is abbreviated since that version does
not provide time in the multicast. Thus, the time and offset fields
are null.
