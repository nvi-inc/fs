Comments: 
This command is used to get UNIX system commands executed. The UNIX
command is executed under your default shell. Any response or error from the
command will be logged in the Field System log.

Normally, if you need to execute a UNIX command, use the operator menu
to open a new window temporarily and type your commands and see the
output there. The sy command should be used only if there is a need for a
system command in a procedure or schedule.

Any valid UNIX command that does not require input may be used. There is
no facility for accepting user input when you use the sy command.

Since commands could take some time to execute and therefore tie up the Field
System, it is recommended that commands used with sy be executed in the
background. To have a command run in background and not wait for its
completion, append an & to the command. If you do want to wait until the
command finishes, do not use the &.
