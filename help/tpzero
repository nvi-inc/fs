TPZERO - Measure zero levels

Syntax:   TPZERO=<list>
Response: TPZERO/<zero levels>

Settable parameters: 
<list>: list of modules for which zero levels are to be measured.
        Refer to the description of <list> under the TPI command.

Monitor-only parameters:
<zero levels>: list of zero levels, counts. These values are stored
               for use by the TSYS1 and TSYS2 commands.

      Comments: These zero levels are subtracted from all readings
taken on the same module before system temperatures are computed.
Only USB or LSB readings are accepted; if another input is set, the
reading is returned as -1. It is assumed that the IFD is set for
maximum attenuation.
