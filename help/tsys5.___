             tsys - compute and display system temps
 
              Syntax:      tsys=list
          tsys5=list
          tsys6=list
 
              Response:    tsys/systemps
          tsys5/systemps
          tsys6/systemps
 
 
 Settable parameters:
            list       List of modules for which Tsys will be computed.
            Standard mnemonics allowed.
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
            systemps   List of system temperatures, computed from values
            retrieved by the tpi, tpical, and tpzero commands.
            -1.0 means no caltemp could be found for this
            detector.
 
 Comments: 
 This command calculates and displays system temperatures for
 the different video and IF channels.The formula for Mark III/IV is:
 
         tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/(tpdiff))

 For VLBA/4 the formula is:

          tsys = (tpi/(tpgain*tpgian) - tpzero/(tpdiffgain*tpdiffgain))
	         * (caltemp/(tpdiff/(tpdiffgain*tpdiffgain)))
 
 where:
 tsys         system temperature, as reported in tsys command
 tpi          cal-off reading, from tpi command divided
 tpgain       VLBA TPI gain reading, from tpgain command
 tpzero       zero-level reading, from tpzero command
 tpdiff       TPICAL-TPI reading, from tpdiff command
 tpdiffgain   VLBA TPDIFF gain reading, from tpdiffgain command
 caltemp      noise calibration source temperature, from
              caltemp command.
 
 For VLBA/4 TPGAIN must be a measurement of the gain level
 when TPI is measured and likewise TPDIFFGAIN must be a measurement of
 the gain level when TPZERO and TPDIFF are measured. However, if TPGAIN
 and/or TPDIFFGAIN return incorrect values because of some problem, they
 can be omitted as long as the gain level is the same for all tpi, tpzero,
 and tpdiff.

 For all systems, the tpi value used for tpdiff may be different from
 the valued use for tpi use for Tsys. The tpidiff is used to define
 the conversion factor from counts to degrees (according to caltemp) only
 Please see the default CALTSYS, PREOB, and MIDOB procedures for examples
 of how Tsys is used.
 
 Except for station defined detectors, the results are returned
 grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value, the output is
 collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have no IF
 assigned are displayed first followed by Ifs 1-3 (Mark III/IV)
 and a-d (VLBA/VLBA4). If the output for an IF would make a
 long output line, the output is split into more than one line.
 For station defined detectors the results are just displayed
 in order: u5, u6.
 
 A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark
 III/IV or VLBA/VLBA4 detector will not prevent results from
 other detectors from being displayed. A negative integer will
 be shown for each channel that had an error that prevented an
 actual measurement from being displayed. An overflow value,
 larger than 999999.9 is displayed as dollar signs, $$$$$$$$.
 
 For Mark III/IV racks the detector mnemonics for the VC are
 displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s is for
 the detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u (upper), l
 (lower), or a digit 4-7 for other detectors.
 
 For station dependent detectors, the tsys5 and tsys6 commands
 are used to match the detectors to the corresponding caltemp5
 and caltemp6.
