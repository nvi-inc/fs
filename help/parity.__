parity - measure parity errors
Syntax:      parity=pemax,syncmax,channel,
             aux,tracks

Response:    parity/parity-errors
             parity/sync-errors


Settable Parameters:
pemax              maximum allowable parity errors per channel
                   per megabyte of data. Default is 600. If
                   errors exceed threshold, an error message is
                   issued.
syncmax            default is 12. Otherwise handled the same as
                   parity error threshold.
channel            decoder channel. Can be a, b, or ab
                   (default).
aux                aux data check, on (default) or off. Not
                   supported for VLBA.
tracks             list of recorder tracks on which to measure
                   errors. Default is the currently enabled tracks.
                   Values must be between 1 and 28, and/or
                   may be specified by groups (g1,g2,g3,g4)
                   as in the enable command.

Monitor-only parameters:
parity-errors      for each track in the list, the corresponding
                   parity errors (smallest of 4 samples).
sync-errors        for each track in the list, the corresponding
                   sync errors (smallest observed value over the
                   same 4 sample intervals as the parity error
                   check).

Comments: 
Issuing this command with a list of tracks (or parity= for
currently enabled tracks) sets up the command. Issuing the
command with no parameters then measures errors. 

If the auxiliary data field was set using the form or head
positioning commands, then it is checked for accuracy, unless the
aux parameter is off. An error message is issued if the auxiliary
data on the tape does not agree with the value last sent to the
formatter.

If so many tracks are decoded that the response extends beyond
about 100 characters, then another response line is generated.

The decoder channels used to read the data can be specified, either
a, b, or both a and b reproduce channels can be used. If pcalr is
running, it should be suspended before starting this command so
that there's no competition for the b channel.
