             parity - measure and check parity errors

Syntax:     parity=pemax,syncmax,channel,aux,tracks
            parity

Response:   parity/parity-errors
            parity/sync-errors


Settable Parameters:
pemax     Maximum allowable parity errors per channel per megabyte
          of data. Default is 600. If errors exceed threshold, an
          error message is issued.
syncmax   Default is 12. Otherwise handled the same as parity error
          threshold.
channel   Decoder channel. Can be a, b, or ab (default).
aux       Aux data check, on (default) or off. Not supported for
          VLBA.
tracks    List of recorder tracks on which to measure errors.
          Default is the currently enabled tracks. For Mark III
          drives, tracks and must be between 1 and 28, and/or may
          be specified by groups (g1, g2, g3, g4) as in the enable
          command. For VLBA drives, tracks must be between 0 and
          35, or specified by groups (g0, g1, g2, g3) as in the
          enable command, or specified as non-system tracks in the
          VLBA groups (v0, v1, v2, v3),or specified as the Mark III 
          tracks in the VLBA groups (m0, m1, m2, m3). For Mark IV,
          values are Mark IV/VLBA tracks and must be between 0 and
          35, and/or may be specified by all which means tracks 2
          through 33.

Monitor-only parameters:
parity-errors For each track in the list, the corresponding parity
              errors (smallest of 4 samples).
sync-errors   For each track in the list, the corresponding sync errors
              (smallest observed value over the same 4 sample intervals
              as the parity error check).

Comments:
Issuing this command with an equal sign without or without a list
of parameters sets up the command. Issuing the command with no
equal sign then measures errors.

This command assumes the read head stack is positioned
appropriately for the tracks that will be read. The heads that are
used to reproduce data are automatically mapped from even to odd or
vice-versa depending on the reproduce electronics specified in the
head.ctl control file. For VLBA and VLBA2 drives the write head
parameter controls which heads are used. If a mixture odd asnd even
heads are requested no mapping is done.

If the auxiliary data field was set using the form or head
positioning commands, then it is checked for accuracy, unless the
aux parameter is off. An error message is issued if the auxiliary
data on the tape does not agree with the value last sent to the
formatter.

If so many tracks are decoded that the response extends beyond
about 100 characters, then another response line is generated.

The decoder channels used to read the data can be specified, either
a, b, or both a and b reproduce channels can be used. If pcalr is
running, it should be suspended before starting this command so
that there's no competition for the b channel.

Five error readings are made from the decoder or DQA, spaced 0.25
seconds apart. Actual parity errors are the difference between
successive readings. The minimum of the 4 parity error values is
reported in the response. (In versions before FS8.0, the Mark III
command used a time difference of 0.34 seconds.) Each round trip
communication with the decoder takes approximately 0.12 sec, plus
the 0.25 seconds wait time yields 48 seconds to check 28 tracks, 24
seconds to check 14 tracks.

Parity errors are reported as the number of errors per 1 million
bits of data. The actual number of parity errors is scaled to
account for the tape speed during playback.
