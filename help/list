         following:
        <null> to start two lines before the line currently being
               executed 
        #<line> to start at a particular line number in a schedule
        <time> to start at the line which has a time equal to or

      Comments: Ten lines of the current schedule, with line
numbers, are listed on the terminal. If the current executing line
of the schedule is included in the range listed, it is identified
by a leading ">". Only the active schedule may be listed with this
command. This is a display-only response - no information is
logged.
