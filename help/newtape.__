        newtape - halt schedule until new tape is mounted

Syntax:     newtape

Response:   newtape/"To continue, use LABEL command"


Comments: 
This command in effect is the same as the halt command. Execution
will continue after the label command has been successfully
completed. The cont command will also work.
