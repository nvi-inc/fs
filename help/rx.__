Comments: 
This command is used to control and monitor a standard cryogenic
CDP S/X receiver. Command uc is identical to rx except it is for
a uncooled receiver.

MAT module functions are available.

Channel assignments for the "standard" receiver are on the next
page. Your station's channel assignments are in the rxdef.ctl file.
Details of the MAT protocol are in the MAT Communications
manual.

RX must be specified in matad.ctl control file.
