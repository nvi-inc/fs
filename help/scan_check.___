Settable parameters: None

Monitor-only parameters:
            scan        scan number
            label       scan label
            mode        Data mode: ?, st, mark4, vlba, tvg, SS
	                (Mark 5A only)
            submode     Data submode:
                        "8", "16", "32", or "64", if the mode is "mark4" or "vlba";
                        "mark4" or "vlba" if the mode is "st".
	                (Mark 5A only)
            time        Data time tag read from first encountered header
            length      Scan length (seconds)
            rate        Track data rate, excludes parity bits; will always
                         be 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 (Mbps)
	                (Mark 5A only)
            missing     Number of missing bytes

            type        Data type: - (i.e., Mark 5B), tvg, SS
	                (non-Mark 5A only)
            code        For Mark 5B: the three digit date code, last three
                          digits of MJD.
                        For Mark 5C: undefined, may be null
                        For FlexBuff: estimated number of bitstreams recorded,
                          should be correct for 'simple'
                          VDIF (roughly nTrack*nVDIFthread).
            total       Total recording rate (Mbps)
	                (non-Mark 5A only)
            error       Mark 5B: " S", " E" or " SE", indicating whether or
                        not the start ("S") or end ("E") (or both "SE")
                        do not fall on an integer second boundary.
                        VDIF: this is not error field for VDIF, if the
                        format is 'simple' VDIF, then the frame size,
                        typically 8032.

If format is ?, the remaining fields are not valid.

This uses the low-level Mark 5 scan_check? command. The displayed
parameters are the output of this command. More information on the
response format can be found in the Mark5A (and dimino) program
documentation at
http://www.haystack.mit.edu/tech/vlbi/mark5/software.html. Follow the
links named "Mark 5A command set" and "Mark 5B command set (Rev
1.12)".

The first form of the command above with parameters mode, submode, and
rate is for Mark5A recorders. The second form of the command above
with parameters type. code, and total is for all non-Mark5A recorders
including Mark 5B, Mark 5C, FlexBuff, as well as Mark6.
