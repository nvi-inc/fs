This uses the low-level Mark 5 scan_check? command. The displayed
parameters are the output of this command. More information on the
response format can be found in the Mark5A program documentation at
http://www.haystack.mit.edu/tech/vlbi/mark5/docs/command5a.pdf.

This command does not work properly for Mark5B recorders.
