If format is ?, the remaining fields are not valid.

This uses the low-level Mark 5 scan_check? command. The displayed
parameters are the output of this command. More information on the
response format can be found in the Mark5A (and dimino) program
documentation at
http://www.haystack.mit.edu/tech/vlbi/mark5/software.html. Follow the
links named "Mark 5A command set" and "Mark 5B command set (Rev
1.12)".

The first form of the command above with parameters mode, submode, and
rate is for non-Mark5B recorders. The second form of the command above
with parameters type. code, and total is for Mark5B recorders.
