RX - Receiver monitor and control

Syntax:   RX=<channel>,<dcal>,<box>,<S>,<X>,<k>,<cal>
Response: RX/<channel>,<dcal>,<box>,<S>,<X>,<K>,<cal>,
            <lostat>,<value>

Settable parameters:
<channel>: hex value or code word (next page). No default.
<dcal>: delay cal heaterr, ON or OFF. Default is ON.
<box>: box heaters. Turn on with A or B (for controller), or OFF.
       Default is A.
<S>,<X>,<K>: IF amplifier controls, ON or OFF. Default ON.
<cal>: noise cal control. May be ON, OFF, OON (Override ON), OOF
       (Override OFf), or EXTernal modulation. Default OFF.

Monitor-only parameters:
<lostat>: status of LO, LOCKED or UNLOCKED.
<value>: reading in A/D channel shown in first parameter. Units are
         appropriate for channel in use.

      Comments: MAT module functions are available (i.e. ALARM and
TEST/RESET). Channel assignments for the "standard" receiver are
on the next page. Your station's channel assignments are in the
RXDEF.CTL file. Details of the MAT protocol are in the MAT
Communications manual.

      RX must be specified in MATAD.CTL control file.
