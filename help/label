LABEL - Enter tape number and check-label

Syntax:   LABEL=<number>,<check>,<print>
Response: LABEL/<number>,<check>

Settable parameters:
<number>: 8 or 10-character tape number, e.g. HS001234
<check>:  4-character check-label corresponding to <number> e.g.
          8E45. If no <check> label appears on the tape, run
          program LABCK to generate it.
<print>:  P to print a bar-coded label. Default null.

      Comments: Normally used after NEWTAPE command has halted the
schedule. There are two different modes of operation depending on
whether the tape number has 8 or 10 characters. When the LABEL
command is entered directly by the operator, 8-character tape
numbers are used. Tape number and check label must correspond or
execution of schedule will not continue. The effect of this command
is the same as that of CONT. Digit zeros (0) and letters Os are
both treated as zeros in both <number> and <check> for operator
convenience.

The ten-character mode will normally be used only by the RWAND
program. In this mode, the first eight characters of <number>
correspond to the tape number, while the tenth character is used
for a checksum. Any other parameters are ignored. A fake check-
label code will be generated if the check-sum is correct.

If the label-printing option is indicated by the third parameter
(P), program PRLAB will be scheduled to print the tape label on the
Epson MX-80 printer. The label will be for the tape whose end time
is still in the future  currently running SNAP schedule file.
