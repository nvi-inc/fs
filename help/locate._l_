    locate - locate head stack position (longitudinal drives)

Syntax:     locate=range,nsamples,step,stack

Response:   locate/range,nsamples,step,stack,peakv,mper,vltlc

                  
Settable parameters:
range     ñ range to search over in microns. Default is 200.
nsamples  Number of power samples for each measurement position.
          Default is 1.
step      Micron step size between measurement positions. Default
          is 40.
stack     Head stack to move: 1, 2, write or read. Default is 2
          for Mark III/IV and VLBA4, and 1 for VLBA. Only 1 is
          valid for VLBA and MK3B recorders. The value write is
          synonymous with 1 and read is synonymous with 2, even
          if the heads are wired differently. Only the first
          character for write and read is checked; these
          possibilities are provided for backward compatibility
          only.

Monitor-only parameters:
peakv     peak measured voltage from power detector
mper      minimum sample voltage as a percentage of peakv
vltlc     location of the peak in positioner voltage

Comments: 
This command performs a coarse grid search for the largest
detected power over the search range.  The search is performed
over a range of ñrange microns about the initial head position.
The number of positions sampled is ((2*range)/step)+1. The actual
positions at which measurements are made are not exactly step
microns part. The head stack will be positioned within ñ5 microns
of the nominal positions. This approximation is used to reduce
the time moving the head stacks by not over-refining the
positions of what is a coarse search anyway. In the worst (too
coarse) case two positions might be step+10 microns apart.

After sampling over the complete range, locate returns the head
stack to the position that gave the highest power level, makes a
new measurement and reports these values for the peakv, mper, and
vltlc parameters.

This command requires that the reproduce power detector be
hooked-up with a reasonable amount of attenuation and that the
head.ctl control file correctly identify which detector (odd or
even) is in use. This command must be issued once with parameters
to set it up. Issuing the command subsequently without parameters
will start a search. The tape must moving and there must be
recorded data to reproduce for this command to do something
useful.
