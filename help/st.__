                    st - start tape recording

Syntax:     st=direction,speed,record

Response:   st/direction,speed,record


Settable parameters:
direction for  to move tape forward, rev to move in reverse. rev is
          not permitted for S2 drives. No default, except for S2,
          which defaults to for. When the tape is stopped, this
          parameter is displayed in the response as rev for Mark III
          and IV.
speed   Tape speed in inches per second, either nominal or actual.
        For Mark III & IV and VLBA drives, choices are:
        Nominal:3.75    7.5    15     30    60    120    240
        Actual: 4.21875 8.4375 16.875 33.75 67.5  135    270
        VLBA: 4.44    8.88   16.66  33.33 66.66 133.33 266.66
        Thin:   2.5     5      10     20     40    80    160    320
        Mark III & IV and VLBA drives can be commanded to any of
        these speeds, except Mark III & IV drives cannot use the
        "VLBA" speeds or 2.5 ips and the VLBA drives cannot be
        commanded to 320 ips. All of these drives will accept a
        speed of 0. Note that specifying a "nominal" speed selects
        the corresponding "actual" speed. No such mapping occurs
        for "VLBA" and "thin" speeds; these are the actual speeds
        in these cases. For backward compatibility with an error in
        an earlier version of the FS, actual value 4.21875 may also
        be selected by using values 3 and 3.375 (and 3.38 for
        VLBA);  8.4375 may selected using values 7 and 7.875 (and
        7.88 for VLBA) may still be used. These additional nominal
        values are deprecated and will be removed in a future
        version. Since the VLBA drives only have speed resolution
        of 0.01 ips, the actual speeds are 4.22, 8.44, and 16.88
        instead of 4.21875, 8.4375, and 16.875, respectively, but
        either may be entered in a command.
        For S2 drives, the only choices are slp and lp. Also for S2
        drives there are additional monitor only values of: sp,
        unknown, or a reported hex value that doesn't correspond to
        a known speed. 
        For Mark III/IV drives the default speed is 120 ips. There
        is a default speed for VLBA (or VLBA2) drives only when the
        bit_density and form commands have been issued. the default
        speed is calculated from these commands. No default for S2
        drives.
record    on to record; off to disable recording. Default is on. For
          S2 recorders, record and play are synonymous with on and
          off, respectively. Also for S2 recorders there are
          additional monitor only values of rewind, ff, stop, ppause,
          rpause, cue, review, notape, and position.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The tape is started moving. For Mark III, the record bit is enabled
if record is on. For Mark IV, the general record bit is enabled and
the record bit for each enabled stack is enabled if record is on.
For VLBA, the track groups are enabled if record is on; they are
disabled if record is off. For all systems, reproduce mode is not
changed and the state of the low tape sensor is not changed. For
Mark III speeds, the rate generator is set to 720, for Mark IV
speeds it is set to 853.

For all drives except S2, the vacuum (drive ready for VLBA2 drives)
is checked before the command is issued to the recorder. If the
vacuum state (drive state for VLBA2 drives) is not ready, no
further commands are sent. Vacuum (drive ready for VLBA2 drives) is
not checked if speed is 0. A given tape speed of 0 does not move
tape but does enable write heads, thus making bypass mode useful.
To see the time displayed on the decoder front panel while the tape
is stopped, set up the desired reproduce tracks with the repro
command and then issue the command st=for,0,on.

For S2 drives, if the recorder is already recording and a speed
different than what is use is requested, no change will be made and
error will be reported.
