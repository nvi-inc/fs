                    st - start tape recording

Syntax:     st=direction,speed,record

Response:   st/direction,speed,record


Settable parameters:
direction for  to move tape forward, rev to move in reverse. rev is
          not permitted for S2 drives. No default, except for S2,
          which defaults to for. When the tape is stopped, this
          parameter is displayed in the response as rev for Mark III
          and IV.
speed   Tape speed in inches per second, either nominal or actual,
        no default except for VLBA (and VLBA2). Choices for Mark
        III are:
        Nominal:  3     7     15     30    60   120  240
        Actual: 3.375 7.875 16.875 33.75 67.5   135  270
        For VLBA drives the same choices are available, but 80,
        133.33, 160, and 266.66 may also be specified as actual
        speeds. Also since the VLBA drives only have speed
        resolution of 0.01 ips, the actual speeds are 3.38, 7.88, and
        16.88 instead of 3.375, 7.875, and 16.875, respectively, but
        either may be entered in the command. A default speed can
        be used if the bit density has been specified and the
        formatter has been set-up, see the comments below.
        For Mark IV drives, additional choices are: 0, 5, 10, 20,
        40, 80, 160, 320.
        For S2 drives, the only choices are slp and lp. Also for S2
        drives there are additional monitor only values of: sp,
        unknown, or a reported hex value that doesn't correspond to
        a known speed. 
        No default except for the VLBA or VLBA2 drives when the
        bit_density and form commands have been issued. When the
        tape is stopped, this parameter is reported as 0. For Mark
        IV recorders, a requested tape speed of 0 and record on
        will enable the write heads but will not move the tape.
record    on to record; off to disable recording. Default is on. For
          S2 recorders, record and play are synonymous with on and
          off, respectively. Also for S2 recorders there are
          additional monitor only values of rewind, ff, stop, ppause,
          rpause, cue, review, notape, and position.

Monitor-only parameters: none



Comments: 
The tape is started moving. For Mark III, the record bit is enabled
if record is on. For Mark IV, the general record bit is enabled and
the record bit for each enabled stack is enabled if record is on.
For VLBA, the track groups are enabled if record is on; they are
disabled if record is off. For all systems, reproduce mode is not
changed and the state of the low tape sensor is not changed. For
Mark III speeds, the rate generator is set to 720, for Mark IV
speeds it is set to 853.

For all drives except S2, the vacuum (drive ready for VLBA2 drives)
is checked before the command is issued to the recorder. If the
vacuum state (drive state for VLBA2 drives) is not ready, no
further commands are sent. Vacuum (drive ready for VLBA2 drives) is
not checked if speed is 0.

For Mark III and IV recorders there is no default speed. For VLBA
(and VLBA2) systems, a default speed can be used if the formatter
has been set-up and the bit density has been specified with the
bit_density command. See the bit_density command for more details.

A given tape speed of 0 does not move tape but does enable write
heads, thus making bypass mode useful. To see the time displayed on
the decoder front panel while the tape is stopped, set up the
desired reproduce tracks with the repro command and then issue the
command st=for,0,on.

Examples:
st=for,320        #94(>
                  #94=%80000001$
                  #94=)F8530000$

st=for,135        #94(>
                  #94=%80000000$
                  #94=)E7200000$

st=rev,160        #94(>
                  #94=%80000001$

st=rev,80,off       #94(>
                  #94=%00000001$
