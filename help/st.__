st - start tape recording
Syntax:      st=direction,speed,record

Response:    st/direction,speed,record


Settable parameters:
direction         for to move tape forward, rev to move in reverse. No
                  default. When the tape is stopped, this parameter is
                  displayed in the response as rev for Mark III and IV.
speed             Tape speed in inches per second, either nominal or actual.
                  Choices for Mark III and VLBA are:
                  Nominal:  3    7 15   30   60   120  240
                  Actual:   3.375  7.875   16.875    33.75  
                            67.5   135     270
                  For Mark IV recording, additional choices are: 0, 5,
                  10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320. No default. When the
                  tape is stopped, this parameter is reported as 0. For Mark
                  IV recorders, a requested tape speed of 0 and record on
                  will enable the write heads but will not move the tape.
record            on to record; off to disable recording. Default is on.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The tape is started moving. For Mark III, the record bit is enabled if record
is on. For Mark IV, the general record bit is enabled and the record bit for
each enabled stack is enabled if record is on. For VLBA, the track groups
are enabled if record is on; they are disabled if record is off. For all
systems, reproduce mode is not changed and the state of the low tape sensor
is not changed. For Mark III speeds, the rate generator is set to 720, for Mark
IV speeds it is set to 853.

For all recorders, the vacuum is checked before the command is issued to the
recorder. If the vacuum state is not ready, no further commands are sent.
Vacuum is not checked if speed is 0.

A given tape speed of 0 does not move tape but does enable write heads, thus
making bypass mode useful. To see the time displayed on the decoder front
panel while the tape is stopped, set up the desired reproduce tracks with the
repro command and then issue the command st=for,0,on.
