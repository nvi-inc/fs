 Comments: 
 Refer to the Mark IV Formatter Vocabulary manual for a
 description of all valid commands and their syntax.
 
 This command is a simple feed-through to the Mark IV
 formatter. No checking is done on the command, no action is
 taken for any response. This form of the command is temporary
 while it is determined what standard parameters are desired.
 
 The command is sent to the MAT bus just as if the operator had
 used the mat command. No modifications are made before the
 command is sent on the bus.
