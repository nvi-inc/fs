            Response:   source/name,ra,dec,epoch,wrap,ranow,decnow,today


Settable parameters:
        name    Source name, up to 10 characters. No default. Special
                source names are recognized by many antenna interface
                programs. Some names and their meaning are:
            
                  azel      true corrected coordinates
                  azeluncr  encoder units
                  xy        encoder units

                Other specialized names are described in the comments
                below. If name is sun or moon, no position is
                required, and if given it will be ignored.

        ra      Right ascension, in numeric angle/hours format. No
                default. If name is azel or azeluncr, this parameter
                is interpreted as an azimuth. If name is xy, this
                parameter is interpreted as an X position.

        dec     Declination, in numeric angle/degrees format. No
                default. If name is azel or azeluncr, this parameter
                is interpreted as an elevation. If name is xy, this
                parameter is interpreted as an Y position.

        epoch   Epoch in years. Default 1950.0. This field is checked
                only if the specified angles are right ascension and
                declination. A value of -1 inhibits reduction of
                coordinates, i.e., they are assumed to be topocentric.

        wrap    neutral, ccw (counter-clockwise), cw (clockwise), or
                null (empty) to indicate which wrap (or no specific
                one) the antenna should be on for this source or AzEl
                antenna.  If there is no wrap specified, the antenna
                should go the shortest way if there is more than one
                choice.  The local antenna may or may not respect this
                parameter. Please see extensive remarks about this
                parameter in the Comments section below. 

Monitor-only parameters:
        ranow   Topocentric right ascension for when the source
                commanded
        decnow  Topocentric declination for when the source was
                commanded
        today   Approximate epoch of these coordinates

Comments: 
The antenna will begin moving to the new source when this command is
issued. At some antennas, if the source name is given as azel or
azeluncr, then the ra and dec are recognized as azimuth and elevation
in degrees; if the source name is xy, then the next two fields are
recognized as x and y in degrees.  If the source name is sun or moon,
the appropriate coordinates will be calculated by the Field System
based on the current time and the site position as specified in the
location.ctl file.

Typical interpretations of the following special names may or may not
be supported at any given station. Additional parameters, including
coordinates and cable-wrap are not permitted for these special source
names.

    stow      Pre-defined stow position.
    service   Pre-defined service position.
    boresight Pre-defined boresight position.
    disable   Stops antenna communications. This is useful to
              stop error messages when here is a problem.
    idle      Monitor the antenna position, but do not command
              it. This is the normal start-up state for the
              Field System.
    hold      Maintain the current antenna position.
    setup     Prepare antenna for track
    track     Re-enable antenna tracking

The topocentric place for sources other than the Sun and Moon is
calculated using USNO's NOVAS routines. As used here, the results
should be accurate to better than 10 milli-arc-seconds for the time
that the source is commanded. The effects of light bending and diurnal
aberration are included. For the effect of diurnal aberration
(typically less than about 0.3 arc-seconds in magnitude) to be
calculated accurately the position of the antenna in location.ctl must
be fairly accurate.

If the input epoch is 2000.0, the input coordinates are reduced using
standard IAU precession and nutation models, plus light bending and
aberration (annual and diurnal) to yield topocentric coordinates. If
the input epoch is 1950.0, then the input coordinates are rotated to
2000.0 using the inverse of the rotation used by drudg to rotate from
2000.0 to 1950.0, then they are reduced to topocentric. In schedules,
this has the effect of making the calculated topocentric place of a
source that has mean coordinates of J2000 in the .drg or .skd schedule
file independent of whether drudg puts 2000.0 or 1950.0 coordinates in
the .snp file (to the precision used by drudg in the .snp) file. For
coordinates of other epochs, the coordinates are assumed to be
apparent (no diurnal aberration) and are reduced back to mean
coordinates for 2000.0 using the full theory and then reduced to
topocentric for the current date.

For the Sun and Moon, the topocentric place is calculated to lower
accuracy than other sources since these are large sources and are
generally only used for calibrating small antennas with large beams.

The following paragraphs explain how the support for the wrap
parameter should be implemented for AzEl antennas. The last two
paragraphs of this section also describe the handling of limits for
all antenna types.

The wrap parameter is provided by DRUDG in SNAP schedules for AzEl
antennas.  Some antenna interfaces do not implement this parameter.
However, all should since its use is necessary to execute an observing
schedule correctly.  If this parameter is not implemented, it can be
still be used as information by the operator to select the correct
wrap for a source when a schedule is started or has to be re-started
or possible to override incorrect antenna motion.

Wrap regions are defined as (viewed from above the antenna):
counter-clockwise (CCW), Neutral, and clock-wise (CW).  The Neutral
region is the region where an azimuth can only be reached in one way.
The Overlap region is where there are two options for azimuth,
identified as CCW and CW.  Range of motion for the cable wrap of
greater than or equal to 720 degrees is not currently supported.

Implementation of the cable-wrap parameter has subtleties at the
boundary between the regions.  To determine the correct actions it is
necessary to make the assumption that the source is being commanded
shortly before it will be observed.  This is the situation for normal
schedule driven observing.  This approach will achieve agreement with
the scheduling algorithm.  There are three cases to consider:

(1) The source is commanded as "Neutral", but it is currently in the
Overlap region.  If the source is near the CW end of the Overlap
region, the antenna should be commanded to the CCW region.
Alternatively, if the source is near the CCW end of the Overlap
region, the antenna should be commanded to the CW region.  With this
approach when the source moves into the Neutral region, the telescope
should smoothly make the transition to the Neutral region when the
source reaches it.

(2) The source is commanded as "CCW" and it is in the Neutral region.
If the source is near the CW end of Neutral region, the antenna should
be commanded to the CCW limit to wait for the source to enter the
overlap region.  If the source is near the CCW end of the Neutral
region, the antenna should be sent to the current source position,
which by assumption is in the Neutral region.  As with case (1) above
for the Neutral wrap, this approach will allow the antenna to
transition smoothly to tracking in the correct wrap, in this case CCW,
when the source reaches it.

(3) The source is commanded as "CW" and it is in the Neutral region.
If the source is near the CCW end of Neutral region, the antenna
should be commanded to the CW limit to wait for the source to enter
the overlap region.  If the source is near the CW end of the Neutral
region, the antenna should be sent to the current source position,
which by assumption is in the Neutral region.  As with case (1) above
for the Neutral wrap and (2) for the CCW wrap, this approach will
allow the antenna to transition smoothly to tracking in the correct
wrap, in this case CW, when the source reaches it.

If a source is commanded that is beyond the limits of the antenna, in
general the antenna should go to that limit and "track" as close to
the source as possible (so-called "tracking at the limit") so that
when the source does come out of the limit it can be tracked as soon
as possible.  This is straightforward for axes that do not have
"wraps", i.e., not azimuth.  For azimuth the correct handling of the
limits is described above.

If the antenna is tracking a source that moves into the limit, the
antenna should adopt the approach of "tracking at the limit".  This
will allow the slewing calculation for the next source to have the
best chance of being accurate.  In particular for azimuth it should
not attempt to "unwrap" to get to the source.
