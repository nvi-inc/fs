FORM - Formatter control and monitor

Syntax:   FORM=<output>,<rate>,<input>,<synch>,<aux>
Response: FORM/<output>,<rate>,<input>,<synch>,<test>,
            <sign>,<run/test>,<rem/lcl>,<pwr>,<daytime>

Settable parameters:
<output>: Matrix output mode to tape. Default mode B. Choices are
          A, B, C, or D.
<rate>:   Sample rate in Mbits/sec. Default 4. Choices are 0.125,
          0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0.
<input>:  Source of data. Choices are NORmal, EXTernal, CRCc test
          pattern. Default NOR.
<synch>:  Synch test ON or OFF. Default ON.
<aux>:    Auxilliary data, up to 4 hex characters. Default blanks.
          If more than 4 characters are given, only the first 4 are
          used. If <aux> is non-blank, then the PARITY command will
          check for its validity.

Monitor-only parameters:
<test>:    synch test FAIL or OK
<sign>:    synch voltage + or -
<daytime>: clock reading in format: ydddhhmmss.ss
<rem/lcl>: switch setting, REMote or LoCaL
<pwr>:     power interrupt detected, OK or PWR
<run/set>: switch setting RUN or SET

      Comments: MAT module functions available except RESET. 

It may take the formatter up to 4 seconds to re-synch itself if a
change is made to a low sample rate. During this time the read-back
may not be accurate. This module must be reset manually using the
front panel pushbutton in order to clear error conditions; then
turn off alarm remotely. The eight LEDS on the rear panel of the
formatter give some error conditions which are not available
remotely.

Parts of the auxilliary data field for the formatter are filled in
automatically with the tape head offset and pass number by the HEAD
command. The first 4 characters are available to be specified by
the operator with the FORM command.
