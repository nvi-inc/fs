stack - head stack positioning by microns
Syntax:      stack=cmdMw,cmdMr,calW,calR,offset

Response:    stack/cmdMw,cmdMr,calW,calR,offset,
             actMw,actMr,
             deltaMw,deltaMr


Settable parameters:
cmdMw          Write head stack (stack 1) command position in microns.
               Default is not to move.
cmdMr          Read head stack (stack 2) command position in microns.
               Default is not to move. Enter null for VLBA recorders.
calW           Write head stack (stack 1) calibration to use: Forward,
               Reverse, or Uncalibrated. Only the first letter is checked.
               Default is Uncalibrated.
calR           Read head stack (stack 2) calibration to use: Forward,
               Reverse, or Uncalibrated. Only the first letter is checked.
               Default is Uncalibrated. Enter null for VLBA recorders.
offset         auto (default) to automatically adjust the head stack
               positions according to the parameters in the head.ctl control
               file. For none no adjustments are made. Use none for
               Mark IV recording modes and for all mode A recording.

Monitor-only parameters:
actMw          Actual write head stack (stack 1) position, microns.
actMr          Actual read head stack (stack 2) position, microns. Null for
               VLBA.
deltaMw        Difference of actual and commanded position for write head
               stack (stack 1), microns.
deltaMr        Difference of actual and commanded position for read head
               stack (stack 2), microns. Null for VLBA.

Comments: 
This command is used to position the head stacks in micron units. An
individual head stack may be moved by not specifying the command position
and calibration to use for the other head stack. For VLBA recorders, only the
write head stack parameters are used; read head stack parameters are reported
as null. For Mark IV, the write parameters refer to head stack 1, read
parameters refer to head stack 2.

The deltam parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus
commanded.

The command positions reported by the lvdt, pass, and stack commands
are consistent. See the description of the pass command for more
information.

The head stack position in microns is determined by

position = cmdM + absolute offset          (Forward calibration)
position = cmdM + absolute offset + 
             for/rev offset                (Reverse calibration)
position = cmdM                            (Uncalibrated)

where cmdM is the commanded position and the absolute offset and
forward/reverse offset are specified in the head.ctl control file.

If offset is auto, and the calibration is Reverse, and the head stack is
defined as odd in the head.ctl control file, then an offset of 698.5 microns is
added to the head stack position.

If offset is auto, and the calibration is Forward, and the head stack is
defined as even in the head.ctl control file, then an offset of 698.5 microns
is subtracted from the head stack position.

If offset is none, no offset is applied.

If the head stacks were last positioned with the pass or lvdt commands, the
response calw and calr will correctly identify the calibration used. Odd pass
numbers will be reported as forward calibrations, even passes as reverse
calibrations. Positions commanded with the lvdt command are
uncalibrated.

If the write head stack position is commanded, the auxiliary data field is set
to reflect the commanded position, see the pass command for more
information.
