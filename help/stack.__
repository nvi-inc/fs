stack - head positioning by microns
Syntax:      stack=cmdMw,cmdMr,calW,calR
             stack

Response:    stack/cmdMw,cmdMr,calW,calR,actMw,
             actMr,deltaMw,deltaMr


Settable parameters:
cmdMw           Write command position in microns. Default is
                not to move.
cmdMr           Read command position in microns. Default is
                not to move. Enter null for VLBA recorders.
calW            Write head calibration to use: Forward, Reverse,
                or Uncalibrated. Only the first letter is checked.
                Default is Uncalibrated.
calR            Read head calibration to use: Forward, Reverse,
                or Uncalibrated. Only the first letter is checked.
                Default is Uncalibrated. Enter null for VLBA
                recorders.

Monitor-only parameters:
actMw           Actual write head position, microns.
actMr           Actual read head position, microns. Null for
                VLBA.
deltaMw         Difference of actual and commanded position for
                write head, microns.
deltaMr         Difference of actual and commanded position for
                read head, microns. Null for VLBA.

Comments: 
This command is used to position the narrow track head stacks in
micron units. An individual head may be moved by not specifying
the command position and calibration to use for the other head.
For VLBA recorders, only the write head parameters are used;
read head parameters are reported as null.

The deltam parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus
commanded.

The command positions reported by the lvdt, pass, and stack
commands are consistent. See the description of the pass
command for more information.

If the heads were last positioned with the pass or lvdt
commands, the response calw and calr will correctly identify
the calibration used. Odd pass numbers will be reported as
forward calibrations, even passes as reverse calibrations.
Positions commanded with the lvdt command are
uncalibrated.

If the write head position is commanded, the auxiliary data field
is set to reflect the commanded position, see the pass command
for more information.

See the Narrow Track Calibration manual.
