Comments: 
The flux5/6 commands are used to specify flux models for
station specific detectors u5 and u6. They do not correspond
to a standard IF channesl, but instead to whatever IF is being
supplied to the corresponding station detector.

The commands flux5/6 use the source model and the beam size
specified by the corresponding beam5/6 commands to calculate
the apparent flux density. The parameter model determines
which model is used and which parameters have meaning.
Parameters which have no meaning for a given model will not be
displayed before the corr parameter.

The flux5/6 commands are used for station dependent detectors
u5 and u6.

If model is gaussian, then the source is assumed to consist of
up to two, possibly elliptical, Gaussian brightness
distributions. flux1 gives the flux density value for the first
component. angle1 and angle2 specify the diameters along the two
principal axes. angle2 defaults to angel1. flux2 gives the flux
density value for a second concentric optional Gaussian
distribution, default value 0. angle3 and angle4 give the
principal axes of the second component. angle4 defaults to
angle3.

If model is twopoints, then the source is assumed to consist
of two equally bright points. flux1 is the total flux density
of the two points.  angel1 is their angular separation.

If model is disk, then the source is assumed to consist of a
uniform circular disk brightness distribution.  flux1 is the
total flux density. angel1 is the diameter of the disk.

Once the model is specified, the flux5/6 commands will use the
appropriate beam size to calculate the apparent flux density
of the source when the beam is centered on the brightness
distribution. The approximations given in Dave Shaffer's
antenna check-out memo (see the Antenna Performance manual) are
used to compensate for the finite size of the sources relative
to the beam. Note that these are only approximations and
become very poor as the correction divisor approaches a value
of two. Further note that very few sources are correctly
represented by one of these three models. This command gives a
crude approximation to the true apparent flux density.

Issuing a source=... or a beam5/6=... command will
automatically change the value of the aflux parameters to be a
negative, invalid, number until a correct flux5/6=... command
is issued again. It is recommended that procedures that
include the source=... command and the appropriate flux5/6=...
commands be used to command sources when doing flux density
measurements.

See the description of the fivept and onoff commands for more
details on the use of the apparent flux density values.
