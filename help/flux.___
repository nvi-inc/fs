Comments: 
Source models, for either Mark III (and Mark IV) or VLBA (and
VLBA4) systems, may be specified with the flux1/2/3 and
fluxa/b/c/d commands, respectively. The pairs of commands
flux1/a, flux2/b, and flux3/c are synonymous.

The commands fluxx use the source model and the beam size
specified by the corresponding beamx to calculate the apparent
flux density. The parameter model determines which model is used
and which parameters have meaning. Parameters which have no
meaning for a given model will not be displayed before the corr
parameter.

The flux5/6 commands are used to specify flux models for station
dependent detectors u5 and u6.

If model is gaussian, then the source is assumed to consist of up
to two, possibly elliptical, Gaussian brightness distributions.
flux1 gives the flux density value for the first component. angle1
and angle2 specify the diameters along the two principal axes.
angle2 defaults to angel1. flux2 gives the flux density value for a
second concentric optional Gaussian distribution, default value
0. angle3 and angle4 give the principal axes of the second
component. angle4 defaults to angle3.

If model is twopoints, then the source is assumed to consist of
two equally bright points. flux1 is the total flux density of the
two points.  angel1 is their angular separation.

If model is disk, then the source is assumed to consist of a
uniform circular disk brightness distribution.  flux1 is the total
flux density. angel1 is the diameter of the disk.

Once the model is specified, the fluxx command will use the
appropriate beam size to calculate the apparent flux density of
the source when the beam is centered on the brightness
distribution. The approximations given in Dave Shaffer's antenna
check-out memo (see the Antenna Performance manual) are used to
compensate for the finite size of the sources relative to the
beam. Note that these are only approximations and become very
poor as the correction divisor approaches a value of two. Further
note that very few sources are correctly represented by one of
these three models. This command gives a crude approximation to
the true apparent flux density.

Issuing a source=... or a beamx=... command will automatically
change the value of the aflux parameters to be a negative,
invalid, number until a correct fluxx=... command is issued
again. It is recommended that procedures that include the
source=... command and the appropriate fluxx=... commands be used
to command sources when doing flux density measurements.

See the description of the fivept and onoff commands for more
details on the use of the apparent flux density values.
