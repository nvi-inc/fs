repro - reproduce tracks (Mark IV drive)
Syntax:      repro=mode,trackA,trackB,equalizer,bitrate

Response:    repro/mode,trackA,trackB,equalizer,bitrate


Settable parameters:
mode           Reproduce mode, byp (default) for bypass, read or raw
               for playback.
trackA         track for decoder channel A, between 0 and 35, default 2.
               For tracks on head stack 2, add 100 to the desired track
               number. If mode is read, only tracks from head stack 1
               may be specified.
trackB         track for decoder channel B, between 0 and 35, default 3.
               For tracks on head stack 2, add 100 to the desired track
               number. If mode is read, only tracks from head stack 1
               may be specified. 
equalizer      0, 1, 2 (default if mode is read), 3 or dis (default if
               mode is byp) to select the equalizer installed at location 0,
               1, 2, or 3 in the recorder. Use 80, 135, 160, 270 to
               select the equalizer by playback rate according to the
               following table:
                  Location 0  test/special
                  Location 1  135 or 80 ips (normally used for 4 MHz
                              playback)
                  Location 2  160/270 ips (normally used for 8 MHz
                              playback)
                  Location 3  disable reproduce (used for bypass mode)
bitrate        Clock recovery bit rate, Mb/s. Choices are 16, 8, 4, 2.
               Default is the bit rate that corresponds to the selected
               equalizer. For equalizer 80 or 135, default is 4; for
               equalizers 160 and 270 default is 8. If equalizer is
               dis, this parameter is undefined but is set to have the legal
               value of 4.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
This command sets up the reproduce electronics in the tape drive. MAT
module functions available for Mark IV.

Tracks are Mark IV/VLBA track numbers.

The read mode normally is used only when checking parity errors on the
tape.

Bypass mode looks at the output of the write drivers, therefore it only works
if the selected track is enabled and the general record is on. Use the command
st=for,0,on to set up the write drivers for bypass mode.
