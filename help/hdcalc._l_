   hdcalc - stack calibration calculation (longitudinal drives)
 
              Syntax:      hdcalc
          hdcalc=clear
 
              Response:    hdcalc/writeF,readF,writeR,readR,writeS,readS
 
 
 Settable parameters:
 none, however hdcalc=clear will delete previously calculated
 values
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
              writeF       Forward absolute offset for the write head
              readF        Forward absolute offset for the read head, null
              for VLBA
              writeR       Reverse relative offset for the write head
              readR        Reverse relative offset for the read head, null
              for VLBA
              writeS       Write head scale
              readS        Read head scale, null for VLBA
 
 Comments: 
 This command will calculate new calibration parameters based
 on the voltages saved with the savev command. See the Narrow
 Track Calibration manual for a description of the calculations.
 Only one scale factor is calculated for each head.
 
 Any parameters which cannot be calculated because savev has
 not saved a complete set of voltages will be reported as null,
 i.e. empty.
 
 The VLBA recorder has only one head. Its parameters are
 reported as the write head parameters and the read head
 parameters are null.
