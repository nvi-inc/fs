                satoff - satellite tracking offsets

            Syntax:     satoff=seconds,cross,hold

            Response:   satoff/seconds,cross,hold


Settable parameters:
        seconds Along track offset in seconds, positive leads the
                satellite. No default.
        cross   Cross track offset in degrees. Positive to the left
                of the satellite as view from below facing the direction
                of the satellite's motion. No default.
        hold    track or hold, Default: track.

Monitor-only parameters: None


Comments:
This command allows an offset relative to the nominal position of the
satellite to be commanded.  This command only affects pointing when
the antenna is commanded with the "satellite" command.  See the
"satellite" command for more details.

The seconds parameter is only supported to 0.01 second
resolution. However, to only about one second accuracy if the
satellite mode is not "track".

The cross parameter may not be supported.

The hold option can be used to cause the antenna to stop at the
commanded position in order to, for example, perform a drift scan.
This is most useful if the satellite tracking mode for the satellite
SNAP command is implemented in the antenna interface. For the radc
tracking mode, it is unliklely that the hold option will do anything
useful but depends on the local implementation.  In azel mode the
parameter is meangingless since positioning is stationary by design.
