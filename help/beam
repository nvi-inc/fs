BEAM1, BEAM2, - Set beamsize for FLUXn command.

Syntax:   BEAM1=<angle>
          BEAM2=<angle>
Response: BEAM1/<angle>
          BEAM2/<angle>

Settable parameters:
<angle>: full-width half maximum beam size, displayed in degrees
         of arc.

Monitor-only parameters: none

     Comments: Two beam sizes may be specified with these two
commands. Normally this would be used for IF1 and IF2. The commands
FLUX1 and FLUX2 use the sizes specified as BEAM1 and BEAM2
respectively.

There is no default for the beam size unless the IFD and LO
commands have been issued, in which case the beam size is
calculated from the appropriate LO frequency and the antenna
diameter from the ANTENNA.CTL file by the formula:

         beam size (radians) = 1.05*c/(FREQ*DIAMAN)

The BEAMn=... command will change the calculated values of the
FLUXn command to invalid quantities, until a corrrect FLUXn=...
command is issued.
