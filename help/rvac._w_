           rvac - recorder vacuum (VLBA, VLBA4 drives)

Syntax:     rvac=cmd

Response:   rvac/cmd,mon


Settable Parameters:
cmd       vacuum level to command, inches. No default

Monitor-only Parameters:
mon       vacuum level measured, inches.

Comments:
This command sets the vacuum level of the recorder. However it is
only for test purposes. A vacuum level set by the rvac command
will replaced by the default vacuum level from the control file
the next time a rec=load is executed.

The cmd and mon values are converted to and from the voltages
used by the tape drive using the conversion coefficients in the
tape recorder control file, vdrive1.ctl or vdrive2.ctl.  In
particular this means that the cmd value uses the same
conversion as the specified default vacuum level in the control
file.


There is no previous value (selected by using * as the parameter)
for cmd until it has been commanded at least once since the last
time the FS was started.
