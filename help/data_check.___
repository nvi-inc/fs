             data_check - check Mark 5 recorded data

            Syntax:     data_check

            Response:
            Mark 5A:    data_check/mode,submode,time,offset,period,bytes,
                                   missing
            Mark 5B:    data_check/source,time,code,frame,period,total,
                                   offset,missing

Settable parameters: None

Monitor-only parameters:
            mode        Data mode: ?, st, mark4, vlba, tvg, SS
                        (non-Mark 5B only)
            submode     Data submode: 8, 16, 32, 64, mark4, vlba
                        (non-Mark 5B only)
            time        Data time tag read from first encountered header
            offset      Byte offset from current play pointer to beginning
                        of next 'track' frame header.
                        (non-Mark 5B only)
            bytes       Total #bytes in recording between track frame headers.
                        (non-Mark 5B only)
            missing     Number of missing bytes between last and current
                        'data_check', meaningless if immediately previous
                        'data_check' was in a different scan, or if data
                        are not formatted VLBI data. Null if <#missing bytes>
                        cannot be calculated.

            source      Data source: ext, tvg, or ? (not in Mark 5B format)
                        (Mark 5B only)
            code        Three digit date code
	                (Mark 5B only)
            frame       Frame number from first disk frame header, always zero
                        on second tick.
	                (Mark 5B only)
            period      Fame header period (time units).
	                (Mark 5B only)
            total       Total recording rate (Mbps)
	                (Mark 5B only)
            offset      Byte offset from start-scan pointer to first disk
                        frame header.
	                (Mark 5B only)


Comments: 
If format is ?, the remaining fields are not valid.

This command sets the read pointer 1 mega-byte before the current
write pointer location and attempts to the use the low-level Mark 5
data_check? command. The displayed parameters are the output of this
command. More information on the response format can be found in the
Mark5A program documentation at
http://www.haystack.mit.edu/tech/vlbi/mark5/docs/command5a.pdf.

A future version may allow the position of the read pointer to be set
explicitly, but this can be done with a mk5 SNAP command. To check at
another position "pos", use:

mk5=scan_set = : pos ;
mk5=data_check?
