Comments: 
If format is ?, the remaining fields are not valid.

This command sets the read pointer 1 mega-byte before the current
write pointer location and attempts to the use the low-level Mark 5
data_check? command. The displayed parameters are the output of this
command. More information on the response format can be found in the
Mark5A program documentation at
http://www.haystack.mit.edu/tech/vlbi/mark5/docs/command5a.pdf.

A future version may allow the position of the read pointer to be set
explicitly, but this can be done with a mk5 SNAP command. To check at
positon "pos", use:

mk5=play off pos,data_check?

This command does not work properly for Mark5B recorders.
