               halt - halt execution of a schedule

            Syntax:     halt

            Response:   none


Comments: 

This command halts execution of the schedule until a cont command is
issued by the operator. Once the current schedule command is finished,
no further commands of any kind will be read from the schedule command
stream while the halt is in effect. Interactive commands from the
operator command stream will still be processed. This is an immediate
execution operator command.

Please note that a consequnce of using this command is that any
procedure(s) executing in the schedule command stream will be halted.
This is because the FS cannot know if the operator needs to "panic"
stop or to just gracefully end execution of the schedule, so the
safest action is taken.

It is not possible to execute a "schedule=..." command while the
schedule is halted with partially executed procedures.  This would
require popping any executing procedure(s) off the schedule stack.
The FS will not do this because procedures are considered "atomic".
In some cases, prematurely ending a procedure may leave the system in
an undesirable state, e.g., the noise diode might be left on of a Tsys
procedure is exited early.

If a graceful halt or (re-)start of a schedule is needed, it is
recommended that the operator enter "halt" during a wait for a
time-flow control ("!<time>") or a timed wait ("!+<time to wait>")
command.  If halted during such a wait, a new "scehdule=..." command
can be executed.

If it is not possible to find a suitable wait, the "terminate" command
can always be entered to end FS execuation immediately.  It may be
necessary to correct any undesirable state the equipment is left in as
a result, e.g., the noise diode being left on.
