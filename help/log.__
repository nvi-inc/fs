Comments: 
When the Field System is initialized, log file station.log was opened or created
in directory /usr2/log. If the log file requested by this command cannot be
opened or created, the Field System returns to using the log file previously in
use. If no log file can be successfully opened, execution of the schedule
continues, but an error message is displayed on the screen every time an
attempt is made to write into the log.
