 Comments: 
 This command is a simple feed-through to the Mark IV decoder.
 No checking is done on the command, no action is taken for any
 response. This form of the command is temporary while it is
 determined what standard parameters are desired.
 
 The command is sent to the MAT bus just as if the operator had
 used the mat command. No modifications are made before the
 command is sent on the bus.
 
 This command is for the new  Mark IV decoder which may be
 installed in any of the Mark III, Mark IV, or VLBA4 rack
 types, but this command will work decoder if it is installed
 with other rack types as well.
