           decode4 - Mark IV decoder low-level control

            Syntax:     decode4=command

            Response:   decode/response


Settable parameters:
          command   any legal command for Mark IV decoder. The
          terminating "$" character is  appended before
          sending the command.

Monitor-only parameters:
            data        response to command.

Comments: 
This command is a simple feed-through to the Mark IV decoder.
No checking is done on the command, no action is taken for any
response. This form of the command is temporary while it is
determined what standard parameters are desired.

The command is sent to the MAT bus just as if the operator had
used the mat command. No modifications are made before the
command is sent on the bus.

This command is for the new  Mark IV decoder which may be
installed in any of the Mark III, Mark IV, or VLBA4 rack
types, but this command will work decoder if it is installed
with other rack types as well.

Documentation for the Mark 4 Decoder commands can be found in Mark IV Memo #279.  Mark IV Memos can be found at

which applies to the new Decoder firmware,
which has not yet been widely distributed.]
