logout - set log output unit(s)
Syntax:      logout=dev,dev,...

Response:    none


Settable parameters:
dev            Device name for display of log entries. Up to 5 devices may
               be specified. Default device is the log/display window.

Comments: 
Log entries are always written into the log file, this command is only for
display during operations. All log entry display may be suppressed by issuing
the command logout=/dev/null.

An example of the use of this command is to specify a file name as the device
in order to record a portion of the log file into a separate file. Another
example would be to have the log display appear on a different terminal from
the console screen.

You must have permission to write to any device or file that you specify. If
you specify a device which you do not have permission to write to, an error
will be generated when the Field System attempts to open that device.
