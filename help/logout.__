                 logout - set log output file(s)


                 This command is not implemented.


Syntax:     logout=file,mode,bits,parity,stop
          logout=*,file,mode,bits,parity,stop

Response:   logout/file,file, 


Settable parameters:
dev       File name for display output. This may either be a normal
          file, e.g., /tmp/logout, a pseudo-terminal device file
          that is in use as an xterm, e.g., /dev/pts011, or a
          serial port device file, e.g., /dev/cui1h. No default.
mode      Open mode for file, one of append, write, or a valid BAUD
          rate: 50, 75, 110, 134, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1200, 1800,
          2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, or 38400.  The default is write.
          If a BAUD rate is specified it implies that the file
          being opened is serial device. The remaining parameters
          may be used to define the line protocol.
bits        The number of bits per character transmitted, one of 5,
            6, 7, or 8. The default is 8.
parity      How parity generation is handled: none, odd, or even. The
            default is none.
stop      The number of stop bits, one of 1 or 2. The default is 1.

Comments: 
Log entries are always written into the log file and sent to the
display device for the ddout program. This command can be used to
send the displayed output of the ddout program, both log entries
and information messages (including bus communications echoing) to
other terminals, devices, and files. This command is useful for
recording the displayed output in a file for later examination or
to direct the output to an auxiliary display.

Up to five different output files (or devices) can be in use at any
time. However, only one new device can be specified per logout= 
command. If the logout=*,  form is used, the specified file
receives the display output in addition to those already doing so.
If the form without the asterisk "*" as the first parameter is
used, any files currently in use will be closed and the specified
file will be opened. The command logout= with no parameters will
close any files current receiving output.

The line protocol parameters bits, parity, and stop are useful only if
the mode was specified as a valid BAUD rate. The default mode,
write, will cause the specified file to be overwritten if it
already exists.

If a file is not specified as an absolute pathname, i.e., without
a leading slash "/", the file will be opened in the current
directory that the Field System was started from, usually
/usr2/oper.

Because of the mapping of all command input to lower case, it is
not possible to open a file that contains any upper case letters.
This files can still be opened if they are linked to a another file
name that does not contain upper case letters. For example, the
file /dev/ttyF01 could be linked to /dev/ttyf01 using the UNIX
command: ln /dev/ttyF01 /dev/ttyf01. Then /dev/ttyf01 can be used
as the file name. Also because of the special meaning of asterisk
"*" as the first parameter it is not possible to open a file with
a name of asterisk unless the logout=*,  command form is used.

Files are opened with the permissions of the user that started the
Field System, usually oper.
