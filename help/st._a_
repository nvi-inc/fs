              st - start tape recording (all drives)

            Syntax:     st=direction,speed,record

            Response:   st/direction,speed,record


Settable parameters:
          direction For non-S2 and K-4 drives: for to move tape forward,
          rev to move in reverse. rev is not permitted for S2
          drives, but for is. For K-4 drives: record (or on) or
          play (or off). No default, except for S2 which
          defaults to for, and K4 which defaults to record. When
          the tape is stopped, this parameter is displayed in
          the response as rev for Mark III and IV. Additional
          display values for K-4: ejecting, ff, rewind, loading,
          stop, and NULL
        speed   Tape speed in inches per second, either nominal or
        actual. For Mark III & IV and VLBA/4 drives, choices
        are: (for thick tape) 8.4375, 16.875, 33.75, 67.5,
        135, 270 or (for thin tape) 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160,
        320. A speed of 0 is acceptable as well. Mark III/IV
        drives may also be commanded to 4.21875. For S2
        drives, the only choices are slp and lp. Also for S2
        drives there are additional monitor only values of:
        sp, unknown, or a reported hex value that doesn't
        correspond to a known speed. For Mark III/IV drives
        the default speed is 135 ips. There is a default speed
        for VLBA/4 and VLBA2 drives only when the bit_density
        and form commands have been issued. the default speed
        is calculated from these commands. No default for S2
        drives. Note used for K4.
          record    on to record; off to disable recording. Default is on.
          For S2 recorders, record and play are synonymous with
          on and off, respectively. Also for S2 recorders there
          are additional monitor only values of rewind, ff,
          stop, ppause, rpause, cue, review, notape, and
          position. Note used for K4.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The tape is started moving. For Mark III, the record bit is
enabled if record is on. For Mark IV, the general record bit is
enabled and the record bit for each enabled stack is enabled
if record is on. For VLBA, the track groups are enabled if record
is on; they are disabled if record is off. For all systems,
reproduce mode is not changed and the state of the low tape
sensor is not changed. In the Mark III/IV drives for Mark III
speeds, the rate generator is set to 720 for the "actual"
speed. For "thin" speeds it is set to 853. For 5 ips, the rate
generator is set to 427 and the 7.5 ips button is selected.

For the Mark III/IV drives, the speed 4.21875  ips does not
move the tape. It implements a "load" function.

The nominal track bit rates for longitudinal drives depend on
the tape thickness. For thick tapes the speeds are normally
135 ips/(4 Mbit/sec/track), so-called low density recording.
For thin tape they are normally 80 ips/(4 Mbit/sec/track), so-
called high density recording. Sometimes in the past, the
thick tape speeds were used with thin tapes. This is normally
not done anymore.

For longitudinal drives, the vacuum (drive ready for VLBA2
drives) is checked before the command is issued to the
recorder. If the vacuum state (drive state for VLBA2 drives)
is not ready, no further commands are sent. Vacuum (drive
ready for VLBA2 drives) is not checked if speed is 0. A given
tape speed of 0 does not move tape but does allow the write
heads to enabled accord to the record parameter, thus making
bypass mode useful. To see the time displayed on the decoder
front panel while the tape is stopped, set up the desired
reproduce tracks with the repro command and then issue the
command st=for,0,on.

For S2 drives, if the recorder is already recording and a
speed different than what is in use is requested, no change
will be made and an error will be reported.

For backward compatibility, several other values of the speed
parameter are possible for the longitudinal drives. Nominal
speeds (multiply by 9/8 to get the actual speed) are: 3.75,
7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240. Obsolete "VLBA speeds" for data
replacement format on think tape are: 8.33, 16.66, 33.33,
66.66, 133.33, and 266.66. For backward compatibility with an
error in an earlier version of the FS, actual values 4.21875
may also be selected by using values 3 and 3.375;  8.4375 may
selected using values 7 and 7.875. These additional nominal
values are deprecated as are the  "VLBA speeds" since they are
no longer used. All these deprecated speeds will be removed in
a future version. Since the VLBA drives only have speed
resolution of 0.01 ips, the actual speeds are 4.22, 8.44, and
16.88 instead of 4.21875, 8.4375, and 16.875, respectively, but
either may be entered in a command.

For longitudinal drives, the correlators can not reproduce
recordings made at speeds below 40 ips, but this limitation is
subject to change in the future. This limitation is
functionally equivalent to a minimum per track data rate of 2
Mbit/sec.

For K4 type 2 (DFC2100) drives, the rec_mode SNAP command must
be set-up first to define the time stamp insertion parameters.
