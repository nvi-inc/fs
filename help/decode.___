          decode - Mark III decoder control and monitor

Syntax:     decode=channel,mode,counter

Response:   decode/channel,mode,data


Settable parameters:
channel   Channel a (default) or b to be decoded.
mode      Type of data to be read. Choices are auxilliary data,
          synch, crc word, time, data bits, or error counts
          (default). 
counter   Error counter control: byte (default), frame, reset.

Monitor-only parameters:
data      Data returned according to mode specified in control
          command.
            err   sspppppp (s=synch errors, p=parity errors) Note
                  that monitored error values are error counts,
                  not rates.
            syn   8 - character synch word
            time    two words: ydddhhmm and sssssccc, where ccc =
                    checksum
            data    three sets of 32 data bits
            aux   two sets of 8 characters of auxiliary data
            crc   pass/fail for CRC check

Comments: 
MAT module functions available.  See section 1.0 of this manual.

CRC check is reliable only in bypass reproduce mode.

This command is for the old style Mark III decoder which may be
installed in any of the Mark III, Mark IV, or VLBA4 rack types,
but this command will work decoder if it is installed with other
rack types as well.

Most Mark III drives cannot decode in double speed, so this
command will probably fail in this mode. Old VLBA drives that use
the Mark III bit synchronizer may have this problem also.
