                    echo - echo communications

            Syntax:     echo=set

            Response:   none


Settable parameters:
        set     on to turn echo on, off to turn off (default). Any
        external communications are echoed in the log display
        window.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
Immediate execution operator command for MAT and/or MCB and/or
RCL communications and, at some stations, antenna
communications also.

For MCB communications, each byte is displayed as

                                      bytes sent to the MCB           [nxx]
    bytes received from the MCB     <nxx>

where n is normally a blank. n is + for the first byte of the
address when data is being written to the module. The address
or data is xx, represented as two hex characters. MCB control
bytes are displayed with special 3-letter mnemonics:

      [SYN]     hex 16    synchronization byte
      <ACK>     hex 06    acknowledge
      <NAK>   hex 15    not acknowledge
      <DC1>     hex 11    data control 1
      <DC2>   hex 12    data control 2

For MAT communications, most of the data bytes are printable
ASCII characters which are displayed simply as the character.
The unprintable ASCII characters are displayed as [xxx], where
xxx is shown in the table below. The "del" character (127) is
displayed as [del].

      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9 
      nul soh stx etx eot enq ack bel bs  ht  
    1 lf  vt  ff  cr  so  si  dle dc1 dc2 dc3
    2 dc4 nak syn etb can em  sub esc fs  gs  
    3 rs  us

For RCL communications, each piece of information is displayed
as

                                            information sent to the RCL           [xxx]
    information received from the RCL     <xxx>

where xxx is a representation of the data in an appropriate
format. Information going to the RCL is always displayed in
order of: the name of the command being sent followed by the
parameters for that command. Information returned by the RCL
is always displayed in the order of: the error response code,
and if there is no error, the parameter values returned in the
response.  The names of the commands, and the order of the
parameters sent and received is the same as that in ISTS's S2-
RT User's Manual, Appendix A. In addition whenever possible
menomonics are substituted for numeric parameters. Error and
parameter menonics correspond closely to those in the appendix
of ISTS's manual. Remote errors are displayed as numeric
values until  a successful ERROR_DECODE command has been
completed for that error code. Effectively this means that the
mnemomic is not used in the display of remote errors until the
second time the error is encountered after the most recent
Field System start. If the value of a parameter that is
normally displayed as menomic doesn't correspond to the value
of a known mnemonic for that parameter, the hex value will be
displayed.

For the TIME_READ command the Field System's raw times
immediately before and after the call to rcl_time_read are
displayed in curly braces {} immediately after the returned
data. The Field System's raw time is the number of
centiseconds since the last boot.

For GPIB and Mark 5 communications, commands sent to the
device are placed in square brackets "[]" and responses are
displayed in angle brackets "<>".
