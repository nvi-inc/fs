           mount - pre-mount tape (longitudinal drives)
 
              Syntax:      mount=vsn,check,type
 
              Response:    mount/vsn,check,type
 
 
 Settable parameters:
        vsn    8 or 10-character tape Volume Serial Number (VSN),
        e.g. HS001234.
          check    4-character check-label corresponding to VSN, e.g.
          8E45. If no check label appears on the tape, run
          program labck to generate it.
        type   thick or thin, defaults to type implied by VSN. For
        monitor, this value only appears until the tape is
        loaded with a rec=load command. This parameter is not
        available unless vacuum switching is enabled in sw.ctl
        control file.
 
 Comments:
 This command is similar to the label command, except that it
 does not release a schedule that is halted and in addition it
 issues a command to cause the SNAP procedure  mounter to
 execute.
 
 The mounter SNAP procedure is included in experiment procedure
 files. For all drive types except VLBA  and VLBA4 the
 procedure is empty. For VLBA and VLBA4 the procedure contains
 only rec=load.
 
 This command only comes in the dual recorder forms, mount1
 (with mounter1) or mount2 (with mounter2). It is not available
 for single recorder systems, hence the generic form mount
 (with mounter) does not exist.
 
 Thiscommand is used to pre-mount a tape in advance of a tape
 change in a two recorder system. Only the currently un-
 selected drive (see the select command) may have its tape pre-
 mounted. The intent is that this command can be use to inform
 the FS about the tape will be used next on the drive that is
 not in use thus freeing the operator from having to be
 physically present at the tape change. When the FS is ready to
 load a new tape at the next tape change it will remember the
 presence of the new tape and not halt the schedule with the
 newtape commmand is encountered.  If a tape has not been pre-
 mounted, newtape will stop the schedule as usual.
 
 After issuing this command the operator should take whatever
 steps are necessary to load the tape. For the VLBA and VLBA
 this is automated through the mounter SNAP procedure. For
 other recorders there is no standardized way to automatically
 load the tape, so the operator must take appropriate action.
 
 All other details of this command are the same as those of the
 label, please refer to thatcommand for further information.
