FEET - Position tape

Syntax:   FEET=<footage>
Response: FEET/<footage>

Settable parameters:
<footage>: Actual footage (as read on the counter) at which to
           position the tape.

      Comments: This command starts the tape moving at fast forward
or reverse, monitors actual position once per half second, and
reduces tape speed as it approaches the requested footage. By
slowing down through four speeds, greater precision is achieved
than with the TAPEPOS command. The actual final footage should be
within one or two feet of that requested. This command does,
however, tie up the Field System until the tape has reached the
commanded position. That is, SNAP commands issued while the tape
is moving will not be executed until it has stopped.

If the tape fails to change position for 2.5 seconds, the command
will abort with an error message.
