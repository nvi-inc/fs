Comments: 

This command is intended to provide a way to turn off display of
specific error messages if the operator determines that nothing can be
done to correct the problem. For example if one parameter of a
module's set-up is being reported incorrectly by the hardware, but has
been checked and is known to be correct, the operator can suppress
that one error message rather than unchecking the entire module.  Even
if the error message is suppressed for display, it is still written to
the log.

Use of the "previous value" symbol "*" is not supported for any
parameters of "tnx".
 
The listing form of the command, i.e., just "tnx", displays errors
that have been suppressed.  Each error is listed in a separate log
entry.

If the off/on parameter is 'on' display of the message is
reenabled.

The #num is only needed if more than instance of an error with the
specified code,number has ocurred. If there is more than one instance
and #num is not specified, all instances that have occurred so far are
displayed with their corresponding "num" values along with a
suggestion to use the #num form.

This command must be used with great care. If misused it may
turn off important error messages that the operator needs to
know about. Consequently, its use is blocked if it is executed
from a procedure, schedule, or time-list. This command must be
entered interactively. The list of suppressed error messages
is cleared every time the FS is started. Turning off an error
message is not the same as correcting the underlying problem,
which is the preferred method of dealing with a problem.
