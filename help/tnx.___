                tnx - thanks for the error report
 
              Syntax:      tnx=mnemonic,number,off/on
 
              Response:    tnx/list
 
 
 Settable parameters:
          mnemonic Two character error code, e.g., sp.
        number   Error message number, e.g., -999.
            off/on     Display status on or off (default).
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
            list       List of error messages for which display is turned
            off, in format: mnemonic,number, one log entry per
            error.
 
 Comments: 
 This command can be used to suppress the display of an error
 message on the FS display. Even if the error message is
 suppressed for display, it is still written to the log.
 
 This command is intended to provide a way to turn off display
 of specific error messages if the operator determines that
 nothing can be done to correct the problem. For example if one
 parameter of a module's set-up is being reported incorrectly
 by the hardware, but has been checked and is known to be
 correct, the operator can suppress that one error message
 rather than unchecking the  entire module.
 
 If the off/on parameter is on display of the message can be
 reenabled.
 
 This command must be used with great care. If misused it may
 turn off important error messages that the operator needs to
 know about. Consequently, its use is block if it is executed
 from a procedure, schedule, or time-list. This command must be
 entered interactively. The list of suppressed error messages
 is cleared every time the FS is started. Turning off an error
 message is not the same as correcting the underlying problem,
 which is the preferred method of dealing with a problem.
 
 If the command is given with no arguments a list of the error
 messages that are suppressed from display is given. Each error
 is listed in a separate log entry.
 
 This command can't distinguish between the different error
 messages with the same mnemonic and number, but different
 additional information, such as which VC or BBC is causing the
 error. If a message like that is suppressed, it will be
 suppressed in all cases. This may be corrected in a future
 version.
