Comments: Multiple commands can be sent with one mk5 command by
separating them with commas. The responses for each command are
displayed in separate output records. Output records, including the
operator display time-tag are formatted to fit within the 99 columns
of standard operator display window (Login Shell) Responses that are
too long for this are split into multiple lines, preferentially at
colons, commas, and spaces in that order. If all other options fail
an arbitrary break is made.

Please refer to the Mark 5 command set document for details
on available commands and their responses.
