Comments:

Multiple commands can be sent with one 'mk5' command by separating
them with commas. The responses for each command are displayed in
separate output records. Output records, including the operator
display time-tag are formatted to fit within the 99 columns of
standard operator display window (Login Shell) Responses that are too
long for this are split into multiple lines, preferentially at colons,
commas, and spaces in that order. If all other options fail an
arbitrary break is made.

'jive5ab' and 'fb' (FlexBuff) are synonyms for 'mk5' that may be used
to make the command and/or output clearer.

Please refer to the Mark 5 command set document and 'jive5ab' document
for details on available commands and their responses.
