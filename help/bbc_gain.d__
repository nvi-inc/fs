            Response:   bbc_gain/bbc,gainU,gainL,agc,target


Settable Parameters:

            bbc       bbc number, 1,2,...16, or 'all', a numeric value implies
                      2ndpar and 3rdpar will specify 1-255 gain steps in manual,
                      mode, "all" implies 2ndpar will be "man" or "agc", for
                      monitor only numeric value are allowed (and displayed).

            2ndpar    "man" for manual control at current level,
                      "agc" for automatic gain control, or 1-255 which
		      represent linear steps in voltage. A numeric value
                      implies manual control.

            3rdpar    if 2ndpar is "agc", 0-65535 target value; if bbc
                      is bbc number (1-16), then 1-255 which represent
                      linear steps in voltage and implies manual
                      control.

Monitor-only Parameters:

            gainU     upper sideband gain, 1-255 which represent steps of
                      gain (0.5 dB?)

            gainL     lower sideband gain, 1-255 which represent steps of
                      gain (0.5 dB?)

            agc      'man' for manual gain control, 'agc' for automatic.

            target    target level for AGC, 0-65535, null if agc is 'man' 


Comments:
This commmand controls the gain for BBC sideband power read-out.

The monitor form requires a single parameter specifying which BBC to
monitor.
