          mk5relink - re-establish the Mark V connection

            Syntax:     mk5relink

            Response:   none


Comments:
This command can be used to open a new connection to the Mark
5 recorder. If the connection is already open, it will be
closed and new one established. Opening a new connection is
needed after  after the Mark V's control program has been
restarted or its power has been cycled. This may happen for
example for a disc swap.

If a schedule is running, but halted, this command will
release the halt if a connection is successfully re-
established.
