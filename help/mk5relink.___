Comments:
This command can be used to open a new connection to the Mark 5 or
FlexBuff recorder. If the connection is already open, it will be
closed and new one established. Opening a new connection is needed
after the Mark 5 or FlexBuff's control program has been restarted or
its power has been cycled. This may happen for example for a disk
swap.

If a schedule is running, but halted, this command will release the
halt if a connection is successfully reestablished.

The 'fb_relink' command is a synonym for 'mk5relink'. Whichever makes
the most sense can be used.
