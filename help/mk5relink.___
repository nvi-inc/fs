          mk5relink - re-establish the Mark 5 connection

            Syntax:     mk5relink

            Response:   none


Comments:
bThis command can be used to open a new connection to the Mark 5
recorder. If the connection is already open, it will be closed and new
one established. Opening a new connection is needed after the Mark 5's
control program has been restarted or its power has been cycled. This
may happen for example for a disk swap.

If a schedule is running, but halted, this command will
release the halt if a connection is successfully re-
established.
