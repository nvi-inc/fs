    worm - estimate inchworm velocities (longitudinal drives)
 
              Syntax:      worm=stack,scale
 
              Response:    worm/stack,scale,fo,so,fi,si
 
 
 Settable parameters:
            stack      Head stack to measure the speed of: 1, 2, write or
            read. Default is 2 for Mark III/IV and VLBA4, and 1
            for VLBA. Only 1 is valid for VLBA and MK4B
            recorders. The value write is synonymous with 1 and
            read is synonymous with 2, even if the heads are
            wired differently. Only the first character for
            write and read is checked.; they are provided only
            for backward compatibility. 
            scale      Scale to use for speed measurement, old (default),
            new, or update. Only the first character is checked.
            The update mode uses the old scale and updates the
            speed in use.
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
          fo       Fast out speed.
          so       Slow out speed.
          fi       Fast in  speed.
          si       Slow in  speed.
 
 Comments: 
 This command measures the inchworm speeds. It must be issued
 once with parameters to set it up. Issuing the command without
 parameters will start a measurement. 
 
 Measurements are made by moving the head stack for 1 second at
 slow speeds and 0.1 seconds at fast speeds in each direction.
 The before and after voltages are compared and the voltage
 scale for that head stack is used to calculate the speed. This
 scheme works best if the inchworm starts well away from the
 limits of its motion. For typical voltage scale factors (170
 microns/volt), the fast speeds measured by this command tend
 be quantized in units slightly smaller than 10; the slow in
 units of about 1.
 
 Either the current (old) or the new voltage scales can be
 used. The old scale is the one most recently read on Field
 System start-up from the head.ctl control file. The new scale
 is the most recently determined scale factor calculated by the
 hdcalc command.
