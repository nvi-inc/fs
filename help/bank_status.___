            Syntax:     bank_status

            Response:   bank_status/active,vsn,seconds,gb,percent,ut
                        bank_status/inactive,vsn,seconds,gb,percent,ut

Monitor-only parameters:
          active        the active bank, a or b
          inactive      the inactive bank, a or b
          vsn           the VSN of the pack in this bank
          seconds       remaining seconds of record time in the
                        current mode for pack in this bank
          gb            remaining gigabytes for pack in this bank
          precent       remaining percentage for pack in this bank
          ut            the time of the last check for this bank

Comments:
This command will check the recording time on the current bank, switch
banks, check the recording time on the new bank, and switch back to
the original bank. This command is provided as way to manually update
the information used in the monit5, "remaining disk capacity display",
for the non-active bank.

This command displays two monitor response records. The first is for
the active bank, the second is for the other bank.

This command takes a few seconds to execute. It should only be
executed when the FS is otherwise quiet. It would potentially be most
useful before starting an experiment to check the status of the disk
modules current installed and to "seed" the monit5 display.

Please note the time remaining is the available record time not clock
time until the bank will be full. The clock time until the bank will
be full may be significantly different, typically around twice as long
for geodesy, depending on the recording duty cycle.

This command will return a Mark 5 error if any Mark 5 process that
conflicts with a bank switch, such as recording, is active (because of
a bug in the Mark5A, there may be no error for this case).
