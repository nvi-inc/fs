           pcalform - specify tones for pcal extraction
 
              Syntax:      pcalform=chan,tone,tone, 
          pcalform=
 
              Response:    pcalform/chan,tone,tone, 
 
 
 Settable parameters:
          chan     Channel of the form ns, where n is 1,..,14 (decimal)
          or 1,...,e (hex) and s is u or l for upper and lower
          sideband respectively. No default.
          tone     Tone to extract, either given in MHz or a pound sign
          # followed by an integer, e.g. #1, to indicate the
          number of the tone to extract. If the integer is
          positive, it indicates the tone above DC. If the
          integer is negative, it indicates the tone below the
          nominal top of the bandpass of the channel. If the
          integer is zero it indicates state counting.
 Comments: 
 The form pcalform= will remove all definitions.
 
 The form pcalform=  allows entry of a table of tones to be
 extracted by channel. Up to 17 tones may be specified for each
 channel. A new specification for a channel overrides any
 previous specification for that channel.
 
 The display form lists all the currently selected tones by
 channel. If a channel requires more than one log entry to
 display all its tones, the tones will continue on following
 lines.
