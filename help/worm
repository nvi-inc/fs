WORM - Estimate narrow-track inchworm velocities

Syntax:   WORM=<head>,<new/old>
          WORM
Response: WORM/<head>,<new/old>,<fo>,<so>,<fi>,<si>

Settable parameters:
<head>:  Head to measure the speed of, READ or WRITE. Only the first
         character is checked. Default is READ.
<new/old>: Scale to use for speed measurement, OLD or NEW. Only the first
           character is checked. Default is OLD.

Monitor-only parameters:
<fo>: Fast out speed.
<so>: Slow out speed.
<fi>: Fast in  speed.
<si>: Slow in  speed.

Comments: This command measures the inchworm speeds. It must be issued
once with parameters to set it up. Issuing the command without
parameters will start a measurement.

Measurements are made by moving the heads for one second at slow speeds
and 0.1 seconds at fast speeds each direction. The before and after 
voltages are compared and the voltage scale for that head is used to 
calculate the speed. This scheme works best if the inchworm starts near 
the middle of its range of motion.

Either the current (old) or the new voltage scales can be used. The
old scale is the one most recently read on Field System start-up from
the HEAD.CTL control file. The new scale is the most recently determined
scale factor calculated by the HDCALC command.
