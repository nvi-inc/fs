FLUX1, FLUX2, - Set flux parameters for a source.

Syntax:   FLUX1=<model>,<flux1>,<angle1>,<angle2>,
            <flux2>,<angle3>,<angle4>
          FLUX2=<model>,<flux1>,<angle1>,<angle2>,
            <flux2>,<angle3>,<angle4>
RESPONSE: FLUX1=<model>,<flux1>,<angle1>,<angle2>,
            <flux2>,<angle3>,<angle4>,<corr>,<aflux>
          FLUX2=<model>,<flux1>,<angle1>,<angle2>,
            <flux2>,<angle3>,<angle4>,<aflux>

Settable parameters:
<model>:  source model, one of GAUSSIAN, DISK, or TWOPOINTS
<flux1>:  flux density of the first source component, Janskys
<angle1>: first angular dimension of the first component
<angel2>: second angular dimension of the first component
<flux2>:  flux density of the second source component, Janskys
<angle3>: first angular dimension of the second component
<angle4>: second angular dimension of the second component

Monitor-only parameters:
<corr>:   correction divisor
<aflux>:  apparent flux density 

      Comments: Two source models may be specified with these two
commands. Normally this would be used for IF1 and IF2. The commands
FLUX1 and FLUX2 use the source model and the beam size specified
by BEAM1 or BEAM2 respectively to calculate the apparent flux
density . The parameter <model> determines which model is used and
which parameters have meaning. Parameters which have no meaning for
given model will not be displayed before the <corr> parameter.

If <model> is GAUSSIAN, then the source is assumed to consist of
up to two, possibly elliptical, Gaussian brightness distributions.
<flux1> gives the flux density value for the first component.
<angle1> and <angle2> specify the diameters along the two principal
axes. <angle2> defaults to <angel1>. <flux2> gives the flux density
value for a second concentric optional Gaussian distribution,
default value 0. <angle3> and <angle4> give the principal axes of
the second component. <angle4> defaults to <angle3>.

If <model> is TWOPOINTS, then the source is assumed to consist of
two equally bright points. <flux1> is the total flux density of
the two points. <angle1> is their angular separation.

If <model> is DISK, then the source is assumed to consist of a
uniform circular disk brightness distribution. <flux1> is the total
flux density. <angle1> is the diameter of the disk.

Once the model is specified, the FLUXn command will use the
appropriate beam size to calculate the apparent flux density of the
source when the beam is centered on the brightness distribution.
The approximations given in Dave Shaffer's antenna check-out memo
are used to compensate for the finite size of the sources relative
to the beam. Note that these are only approximations and become
very poor as the correction divisor approaches a value of two.
Further note that very few sources are correctly represented by one
of these three models. This command gives a crude approximation to
the true apparent flux density.

Issuing a SOURCE=... or a BEAMn=... command will automatically
change the value of the <aflux> parameters to be a negative,
invalid, number until a correct FLUXn=... command is issued again.
It is recommended that procedures that include the SOURCE=...
command and the appropriate FLUXn=... commands be used to command
sources when doing flux density measurements.

See the description of the FIVEPT and ONOFF commands for more
details on the use of the apparent flux density values.
