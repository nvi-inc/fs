TAPEFORM - Specify tape format

Syntax:   TAPEFORM=<pass>,<offset>,<pass>,<offset>, ...
Response: TAPEFORM/<pass>,<offset>,<pass>,<offset>, ...

Settable parameters:
<pass>: the pass number whose offset follows, must be between 1 and
        28*12. 
<offset>: the a priori offset, in microns, for the preceding pass,
          must be between 1 and +/-4000.

      Comments: The passes and offsets must appear in pairs.
Multiple commands are allowed because all of the pairs will not fit
on a single line. These commands appear in standard procedures
named TAPEFORMA, TAPEFORMB, TAPEFORMC, and TAPEFORMD, one for each
recording mode. The appropriate procedure is invoked in the setup
procedure. For example, SX2C1 and SX2C2 invoke TAPEFORMC.
