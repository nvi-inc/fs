		   dot2pps - Report DOT2GPS offset (RDBE racks)

            Syntax:     dot2gps
                        dot2gps=<rdbe>

            Response:   dot2gps(<rdbe>)/<offset>


Settable parameters:
        <rdbe>     letter: 'a','b', 'c', or 'd' for individual RDBE to
                   address. No default.

Monitor-only parameters:

        <offset>   The offset between the DOT clock and the input GPS
                   in seconds. A positive value indicates that DOT came
                   first.

Comments:
Like all RDBE commands, this command can either operate on all active
RDBEs or a particular one.  If no <rdbe> parameter is specified (this
would probably be the most common case), the command will operate on
all active RDBEs.  However, if the <rdbe> parameter is specified as a
single letter in the range of possible RDBEs, the command is for that
RDBE only.  Responses always include the letter of the RDBE in
parenthesizes appended to the command name.  Active RDBEs are defined
by the 'active_rdbes' command.  At start-up all configured RDBEs are
considered active.

To query all active devices use 'dot2gps'.  To query a single device,
use 'dot2gps=<rdbe>'.

Due to the limited precision of the R2DBE's response, the 'dot2gps'
data recorded in the log from the multicast should be used for any
high accuracy work, especially if the value has a magnitude of one
millisecond or more.
