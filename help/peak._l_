    peak - peak up tape reproduce power (longitudinal drives)

            Syntax:     peak=nsamp,iter,stack,vmin
          peak

            Response:   peak/nsamp,iter,stack,vmin,peakv,mper,t/f,vltlc


Settable parameters:
          nsamp     Number of samples to take at each position.
          Default is 3.
            iter        Number of times to iterate peak finding. Default is
            1.
          stack     Head stack to move for peaking: 1, 2, write or read.
          Default is 2 for Mark III/IV and VLBA4, and 1 for
          VLBA. Only 1 is valid for VLBA and MK3B recorders.
          The value write is synonymous with 1 and read is
          synonymous with 2, even if the heads are wired
          differently. Only the first character for write and
          read is checked; they are provided only for backward
          compatibility.
            vmin        The minimum peak voltage that is required before
            the peak is considered "real". Default is 0.2
            volts.

Monitor-only parameters:
          peakv     The voltage measured at the calculated peak
          position.
          mper      The minimum voltage measured at the peak as a
          percentage of peakv.
            t/f         t (true) if the peak is strong enough to be
            considered a real peak and the middle of the last
            three measured positions is within 5.4 microns of
            the calculated peak, f (false) otherwise.
            vltlc       voltage position of the calculated peak response

Comments: 
This command attempts to find the head stack position that
gives the peak response from a track. This should work if the
head stack is already positioned so that there is some
reproduce power coming from the track. The algorithm is:

    (1) Measure the reproduce power at the current position.
    (2) Move 8 microns toward the plate (in) and measure the
    power again.
    (3) If the power at position two is greater than that at
    position one, move another 8 microns in and measure the
    power again. If the power at position two is lower than
    the power at position one, go out from position one 8
    microns and measure the power again.
    (4) Continue moving the stack 8 microns at a time in the
    direction that increases the power until there are three
    measurement with the highest power in the middle
    position. No more than 5 additional measurements are
    made.
    (5) Fit the final three positions to a triangular model for
    the response.
    (6) Move the stack to the calculated peak position. Measure
    the final power level.

When positioning the 8 micron step size is only approximate.
The positioning is done with 2.7 micron tolerance to avoid
spending too much time refining the position.

This command requires that the reproduce power detector be
hooked-up with a reasonable amount of attenuation and that the
head.ctl configuration file correctly identify which detector
(odd or even) is in use.

A reproduce track must be selected with the repro command in
order to peak the power. Depending on the cabling, either
channel A or B should be used. Setting both channels to the
same track is sure to work unless the detector isn't
connected.

In order to identify possibly false peaks, peak requires two
conditions be met before a peak is accepted: (1) the voltage
read-out of the power level must exceed the set minimum and
(2) the calculated peak position must be within +/-5.4 microns
of the middle position of the last three sample values. The
first attempt to peak on a track may fail because of the
second criteria. A second attempt should succeed if that was
the problem.

It may be necessary to raise or lower the minimum voltage if
the noise level is higher than normal or the peak response is
lower than normal.

This command must be issued once with parameters to set it up.
Issuing the command subsequently without parameters will start
a peaking operation. The tape must moving and there must be
recorded data to reproduce for this command to do something
useful.

This command differs from the locate command in two ways. The
first is that locate is intended to do a coarse search only.
peak searches with smaller and more precise steps. Secondly,
locate will return the head to the position of the largest
measured voltage. peak will make measurements until it has
straddled the peak and then will move to an interpolated peak
position.
