HALT - Halt execution of schedule

Syntax:   HALT
Response: none

      Comments: This command halts execution of the schedule until
CONT command is issued by the operator. Once the current schedule
command is finished, no further commands of any kind will be read
from the schedule command stream while the HALT is in effect.
Interactive commands from the operator command stream will still
be processed. This is an immediate execution operator command.
