      rec - tape recorder control (Mark III, Mark IV drives)
 
 
              Syntax:      rec=action
 
              Response:    none
 
 
 Settable Parameters: 
              action       A key word specifying what you want the recorder
              to do. Choices are: 
                             load  Load a tape into the vacuum columns. This is
                  similar to pressing the stop button, but
                  also guarantees that the low tape sensor has
                  not been tripped. On Mark IV drives with
                  vacuum switching it also commands the vacuum
                  level based on the most recent label command
                  before attempting to load the tape. 
                               novac   On Mark IV drives with vacuum switching
                    this removes the vacuum. 
 
 Comments: 
 For Mark III and Mark IV drives without vacuum switching, this
 command can only be used to load the tape. 
 
 For Mark IV drives with vacuum switching, the rec=load command
 sets the vacuum level based on the tape thickness selected by
 the most recent label command. For these drives there is an
 added restriction that the tape thickness be must specified
 with a new label command before every rec=load command. This
 is intended to reduce the likelihood that the incorrect vacuum
 level will be set. Please try to avoid removing the vacuum
 with rec=novac if the tape is moving. Doing so may well damage
 the tape.
