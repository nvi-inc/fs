PATCH - Specify IF patching

Syntax:   PATCH=<LOn>,<VC#><HorL>,...
Response: none

Settable parameters:
<LOn>: Either LO1 or LO2. No default.
<VC#><HorL>: Video converter number with the character "H" or "L"
             appended, e.g. 1H or 3L. "H" indicates the high band
             of the channel, and "L" the low. No default.

      Comments: This command stores the patching information for
access by program PCALR. Phase calibration tone frequencies are
computed using the LO and video converter frequencies. This command
identifies which video converters are patched to channel 1, which
to channel 2. The LO command should also be used to specify the LO
frequencies.
