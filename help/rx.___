                rx - receiver monitor and control
 
              Syntax:      rx=channel,dcal,box,S,X,K,cal
 
              Response:    rx/channel,dcal,box,S,X,K,cal,lostat,value
 
 
 Settable parameters:
            channel    Hex value or code word (next page). No default.
          dcal     Delay cal heater, on (default) or off.
            box        Box heaters. Turn on with A (default) or B (for the
            A or B controller), or off.
            S,X,K      IF amplifier controls, on (default) or off. 
            cal        Noise cal control. May be on, off (default), oon
            (Override on), oof (override off), or external
            modulation.
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
          lostat   Status of LO, locked or unlocked.
            value      Reading in A/D channel shown in first parameter.
            Units are appropriate for channel in use.
 
 Comments: 
 This command is used to control and monitor a standard
 cryogenic CDP S/X receiver.
 
 MAT module functions are available.
 
 Channel assignments for the "standard" receiver are on the
 next page. Your station's channel assignments are in the
 rxdef.ctl file. Details of the MAT protocol are in the MAT
 Communications manual.
 
 The mnemonic RX and the receiver's address must be specified
 in matad.ctl control file.

 Channel assignments for your station's receiver may be found
 in control file rxdef.ctl. Conversion from volts to
 temperature for channels 0 through 6 is 100 deg C/V.
