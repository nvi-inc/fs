       setup_proc - conditional execution of "setup" procedure

            Syntax:     setup_proc=proc

            Response:   setup_proc/proc


Settable parameters:

          proc          setup procedure to be conditionally executed,
                        null to clear memory of any previous 'proc'

Comments:

This command provides conditional execution of a SNAP "setup"
procedure.  If the "setup" procedure was not used in the immediately
preceding instance of this command, it is executed; if it was, it is
not executed. For example, the sequence:


      setup_proc=
      setup_proc=setupsx
      (other commands)
      setup_proc=setup01

will execute both the 'setupsx' and the 'setup01' commands. The
sequence:

      setup_proc=
      setup_proc=setupsx
      (other commands)
      setup_proc=eetupsx

will execute the 'setupsx' procedure only for the first
'setup_proc=...' command.

When a successful 'schedule=...' command changes which schedule is in
use, the memory of which 'proc' was last used is cleared. If all the
setup procedures in a '.snp' file are called via the 'setup_proc'
command, the effect will be that:

  - The first setup procedure before the first scan will be executed.

  - The first setup procedure for a different mode (which will use a
    different setup procedure) will be executed.

  - Any setup procedure for the continuation of the previous mode will
    not be executed.

The use of this feature in a schedule by 'drudg' is controlled by the
'conditional_setup' parameter in 'skedf.ctl'.

This feature can be useful if the "setup" procedures take too long to
execute and/or if the equipment will not tolerate being setup
repetitively.  However, its use involves some risk since if the
execution of the setup procedure fails for some reason, there will be
no subsequent execution of the procedure (until the next mode change
or schedule restart) to possibly fix the problem.  Each station must
decide based on their equipment whether or not to enable this feature
in 'drudg'.

This command will work both in and out of schedules and can used for
any procedures or commands (in place of procedures). However, such
alternate uses may have limited value.

In the future, this feature may used to enable reporting whether the
most recent setup procedure failed and/or reconfiguring the equipment
automatically.
