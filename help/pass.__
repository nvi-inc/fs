           pass - head stack positioning by pass number

Syntax:     pass=cmdPw,cmdPr,woffset

Response:   pass/cmdPw,cmdPr,woffset,cmdMw,cmdMr,actMw,actMr,
          deltaMw,deltaMr


Settable parameters:
cmdPw   Command pass number for write head stack (Mark IV stack
        1), range 1-100 for Mark III and VLBA, 1-112 for Mark IV.
        Default is to not move the write head stack. For Mark IV
        recorders, if the parameter is stack2, then stack 1 is
        moved to the most recently commanded stack 2 position.
cmdPr     Command pass number for read head stack (Mark IV stack
          2), same range as for write head stack. This parameter
          may not be specified for VLBA recorders. If the parameter
          is same, the read pass will be same as the write pass.
          For Mark IV, if the parameter is mk4, then stack 2 is
          positioned to 100 plus the pass number for stack 1.
          Default is to not move the read head stack.
woffset   Type of offset for the write head. auto (default) or
          none. Only the first character is checked. For auto, the
          head stack position is automatically adjusted according
          to the write head type parameter in the head.ctl control
          file. For none, no adjustments are made. Use none for
          Mark IV recording and for all mode A recording. The read
          head is always adjusted.

Monitor-only parameters:
cmdMw   Microns corresponding to command write head pass number.
cmdMr   Microns corresponding to command read head pass number,
        null for VLBA.
actMw     Microns corresponding to actual write head pass number.
actMr     Microns corresponging to actual read head pass number,
          null for VLBA.
deltaMw   Micron error between actual and commanded write head
          position.
deltaMr   Micron error between actual and commanded read head
          position, null for VLBA.

Comments: 
This command moves the read and/or write head stacks to the
position for the commanded passes. The correspondence of pass
numbers to a priori micron positions is established by the tapeform
command. The requested pass must have been set-up by the tapeform
command to be used. Odd pass numbers are used for forward passes,
even for reverse.

Only the write head stack parameters in this command are used for
VLBA recorders. The read head stack parameters are reported as
nulls. For Mark IV, the write head stack parameters refer to head
stack 1, the read head stack parameters refer to the head stack 2.

The head stack position in microns is determined by

position = tapeform offset + absolute offset          (forward pass)
position = tapeform offset + absolute offset + for/rev offset (reverse pass)

where tapeform offset is the a priori offset as specified with the
tapeform command, and the absolute offset and forward/reverse offset are
specified in the head.ctl control file.

If woffset is auto, and the commanded pass is a reverse pass, and the
write head stack is defined as odd in the head.ctl control file,
then an offset of 698.5 microns is added to the write head stack
position.

If woffset is auto, and the commanded pass is a forward pass, and the
write head stack is defined as even in the head.ctl control file,
then an offset of 698.5 microns is subtracted from the write head
stack position.

If woffset is none, then no offset is applied to the a priori offset
for the write head. The read head is always adjusted.

An individual head stack can be moved by not specifying a command
pass number for the other head stack. The read (stack 2) command
pass can be same, which causes it to be the same as the write head
stack pass number. This feature is useful for setting both head
stacks to the same pass number in set-up procedures. The read
(stack 2) command pass can be mk4, which causes head stack 2 to be
positioned to the position for the pass number specified for head
stack 1 plus 100. This feature is useful for positioning both Mark
IV head stacks using a single pass number in set-up procedures.
Also for Mark IV, the write (stack 1) command pass can be stack2,
which causes head stack 1 to be positioned to the most recently
commanded position of stack 2. This feature is useful for
positioning stack 1 (the only stack that can play back) to read
tracks that were just recorded with stack 2.

The deltaM parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus
commanded.

The commanded positions of the lvdt, pass, and stack commands are
reported consistently. For example, if you command the head stack
positions with the stack or pass command, you can determine the
corresponding command voltage with lvdt. And vice-versa, the micron
position corresponding to a voltage position commanded with lvdt
can be determined with stack or pass.

The commanded pass numbers reported by pass are given special
values if either lvdt or stack last commanded the positions. If
lvdt or stack is used with uncalibrated positions, the commanded
pass number will be reported as 0. If the stack command with
forward calibrated positions was used, -1 will be reported for the
pass number, for reverse calibrations -2 will be reported.

For Mark III, when the write head is moved by either pass, stack,
or lvdt, the auxiliary data field used by the formatter is set to
reflect the commanded position. The twelve characters of the
auxiliary data field are set as:

                           xxwxwxyzyzff

xx        ff for forward calibration (odd passes)
          fe for reverse calibration (even passes)
          fd for uncalibrated positions.
wxyz      0000-3999 for positive micron positions
          4000-7999 for negative micron positions
ff          hex characters ff

The positions occupied by wxyz are the four digits of the commanded
micron write head position. In the auxiliary data field the digits
are repeated two at a time.  The negative positions are represented
as the 4000+ absolute value of the position.  The xx field is used
to identify which type of calibration was used to set the position.
The last two digits of the auxiliary data are fixed with the value
ff. 

For VLBA, the auxiliary data field is not supported.

For Mark IV, there are eight characters (32 bits) available for
auxiliary data. They are set as:

                             abcdwxyz

abcd      head stack 0 position in microns
wxyz      head stack 1 position in microns

Characters a and w have the following bit structure:


bit 0     thousands digit for the micron position, usually 0
bit 1     0 for forward calibration (odd passes), 1 for
          uncalibrated
bit 2     0 for reverse calibration (even passes), 1 for
          uncalibrated
bit 3     sign of the position, 0 for positive, 1 for negative
