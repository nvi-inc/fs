pass - positioning by pass number
Syntax:      pass=cmdPw,cmdPr,offset

Response:    pass/cmdPw,cmdPr,offset,cmdMw,cmdMr,
             actMw,actMr,
             deltaMw,deltaMr


Settable parameters:
cmdPw          command pass number for write head stack (Mark IV stack
               1), range 1-100 for Mark III and VLBA, 1-112 for Mark
               IV. Default is to not move the write head stack. For Mark
               IV recorders, if the parameter is stack2, then stack 1 is
               moved to the most recently commanded stack 2 position. 
cmdPr          command pass number for read head stack (Mark IV stack
               2), same range as for write head stack. This parameter may
               not be specified for VLBA recorders. If the parameter is
               same, the read pass will be same as the write pass. For
               Mark IV, if the parameter is mk4, then stack 2 is positioned
               to 100 plus the pass number for stack 1. Default is to not
               move the read head stack.
offset         auto (default) or none. Only the first character is checked.
               For auto, the head stack position is automatically adjusted
               according to parameters in the head.ctl control file. For
               none, no adjustments are made. Use none for Mark IV
               recording and for all mode A recording.

Monitor-only parameters:
cmdMw          microns corresponding to command write head pass number
cmdMr          microns corresponding to command read head pass number,
               null for VLBA
actMw          microns corresponding to actual write head pass number 
actMr          microns corresponging to actual read head pass number, null
               for VLBA
deltaMw        micron error between actual and commanded write head
               position
deltaMr        micron error between actual and commanded read head
               position, null for VLBA

Comments: 
This command moves the read and/or write head stacks to the position for the
commanded passes. The correspondence of pass numbers to a priori micron
positions is established by the tapeform command. The requested pass
must have been set-up by the tapeform command to be used. Odd pass
numbers are used for forward passes, even for reverse.

Only the write head stack parameters in this command are used for VLBA
recorders. The read head stack parameters are reported as nulls. For Mark IV,
the write head stack parameters refer to head stack 1, the read head stack
parameters refer to the head stack 2.

The head stack position in microns is determined by

position = tapeform offset + absolute offset  (forward pass)

position=tapeform offset + absolute offset + 
          for/rev offset                     (reverse pass)

where tapeform offset is the a priori offset as specified with the
tapeform command, and the absolute offset and
forward/reverse offset are specified in the head.ctl control file.

If offset is auto, and the commanded pass is a reverse pass, and the head
stack is defined as odd in the head.ctl control file, then an offset of 698.5
microns is added to the head stack position.

If offset is auto, and the commanded pass is a forward pass, and the head
stack is defined as even in the head.ctl control file, then an offset of 698.5
microns is subtracted from the head stack position.

If offset is none, then no offset is applied to the a priori offset.

An individual head stack can be moved by not specifying a command pass
number for the other head stack. The read (stack 2) command pass can be
same, which causes it to be the same as the write head stack pass number.
This feature is useful for setting both head stacks to the same pass number in
set-up procedures. The read (stack 2) command pass can be mk4, which causes
head stack 2 to be positioned to the appropriate position for the pass specified
for head stack 1. This feature is useful for positioning both Mark IV head
stacks using a single pass number in set-up procedures. The write (stack 1)
command pass can be stack2, which causes head stack 1 to be positioned to
the most recently commanded position of stack 2. This feature is useful for
positioning stack 1 (the only stack that can play back) to read tracks that were
just recorded with stack 2.

The deltaM parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus
commanded.

The commanded positions of the lvdt, pass, and stack commands are
reported consistently. For example, if you command the head stack positions
with the stack or pass command, you can determine the corresponding
command voltage with lvdt. And vice-versa, the micron position
corresponding to a voltage position commanded with lvdt can be determined
with stack or pass.

The commanded pass numbers reported by pass are given special values if
either lvdt or stack last commanded the positions. If lvdt or stack is
used with uncalibrated positions, the commanded pass number will be reported
as 0. If the stack command with forward calibrated positions was used, -1
will be reported for the pass number, for reverse calibrations -2 will be
reported.

When the write head is moved by either pass, stack, or lvdt, the
auxiliary data field used by the formatter is set to reflect the commanded
position. For Mark III, the twelve characters of the auxiliary data field are set
as:

                           xxwxwxyzyzff

xx           ff for forward calibration (odd passes)
             fe for reverse calibration (even passes)
             fd for uncalibrated positions.
wxyz         0000-3999 for positive micron positions
             4000-7999 for negative micron positions
ff           hex characters ff

The positions occupied by wxyz are the four digits of the commanded micron
write head position. In the auxiliary data field the digits are repeated two at a
time.  The negative positions are represented as the 4000+ absolute value of
the position.  The xx field is used to identify which type of calibration was
used to set the position. The last two digits of the auxiliary data are fixed with
the value ff. Auxiliary data field is not supported for VLBA. 

For Mark IV, there are eight characters (32 bits) available for auxiliary data.
They are set as:

                             abcdwxyz

abcd         head stack 0 position in microns
wxyz         head stack 1 position in microns

Characters a and w have the following bit structure:

bit 0        thousands digit for the micron position, usually 0
bit 1        0 for forward calibration (odd passes), 1 for uncalibrated
bit 2        0 for reverse calibration (even passes), 1 for uncalibrated
bit 3        sign of the position, 0 for positive, 1 for negative
