pass - head position by pass number
Syntax:      pass=cmdPw,cmdPr
             pass

Response:    pass/cmdPw,cmdPr,cmdMw,cmdMr,actMw,
             actMr,deltaMw,deltaMr


Settable parameters:
cmdPw           command pass number for write head, range
                1-100. Default is to not move the write head.
cmdPr           command pass number for read head, range
                1-100. If the parameter is same, the read pass
                will be same as the write pass. Default is to not
                move the read head. This parameter may not be
                specified for VLBA recorders.

Monitor-only parameters:
cmdMw           microns corresponding to command write head
                pass number
cmdMr           microns corresponding to command read head
                pass number, null for VLBA
actMw           microns corresponding to actual write head pass
                number 
actMr           microns corresponging to actual read head pass
                number, null for VLBA
deltaMw         micron error between actual and commanded
                write head position
deltaMr         micron error between actual and commanded
                read head position, null for VLBA

Comments: 
This command moves the read and/or write heads to the position
for the commanded passes. The correspondence of pass numbers
to micron positions is established by the tapeform command.
The requested pass must have been set-up by the tapeform
command to be used. Odd pass numbers are used for forward
pass, even for reverse.

Only the write head parameters are used for VLBA recorders. The
read head parameters are reported as nulls.

An individual head can be moved by not specifying a command
pass number for the other head. The read command pass can be
same, which causes it to be the same as the write head pass
number. This feature is useful for setting both heads to the same
pass number in set-up procedures.

The deltaM parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus
commanded.

The commanded positions of the lvdt, pass, and stack
commands are reported consistently. For example, if you
command the head positions with the stack or pass command,
you can determine the corresponding command voltage with
lvdt. And vice-versa, the micron position corresponding to a
voltage position commanded with lvdt can be determined with
stack or pass.

The commanded pass numbers reported by pass are given special
values if either lvdt or stack last commanded the positions. If
lvdt or stack is used with uncalibrated positions, the
commanded pass number will be reported as 0. If the stack
command with forward calibrated positions was used, -1 will be
reported for the pass number, for reverse calibrations -2 will be
reported.

When the write head is moved by either pass, stack, or lvdt,
the auxiliary data field used by the formatter is set to reflect the
commanded position. The twelve characters of the auxiliary data
field are set as:

                        xxwxwxyzyzff

xx           ff for forward calibration (odd passes)
             fe for reverse calibration (even passes)
             fd for uncalibrated positions.
wxyz         0000-3999 for positive micron positions
             4000-7999 for negative micron positions
ff           hex characters ff

The positions occupied by wxyz are the four digits of the
commanded micron write head position. In the auxiliary data field
the digits are repeated two at a time.  The negative positions are
represented as the 4000+ absolute value of the position.  The xx
field is used to identify which type of calibration was used to set
the position. The last two digits of the auxiliary data are fixed with
the value ff. Auxiliary data field not supported for VLBA.
