 Settable parameters:
            rep        Number of repetitions, 1 to 99. Default is 2. 
          intp     Integration period, 1 to 10 seconds. Default is 1. 
          dev1     Device to be used as detector 1. Standard detector
          mnemonics are allowed. Default is i1 for Mark
          III/IV, ia for VLBA/4. Station dependent detectors
          u5 and u6 may be available.
          dev2     Device to be used as detector 2. Standard detector
          mnemonics are allowed. Default is i1 for Mark
          III/IV, ib for VLBA/4. Station dependent detectors
          u5 and u6 may be available.
          cutoff   Elevation above which to step in elevation rather
          than azimuth, in degrees, default 60.
            stp        Distance off source for off source and calibration
            points, in multiples of a beamwidth. Default is 5.0.
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
          cal1     Calibration noise source temperature in degrees K
          for detector 1. This is determined from the last
          caltempx command in conjunction with the patch (Mark
          III/IV) or bbc (VLBA/4) command.
          cal2     Calibration noise source temperature in degrees K
          for detector 2. This is determined from the last
          caltempx command in conjunction with the patch (Mark
          III/IV) or bbd (VLBA/4) command.
            beam1      The full width half maximum beam size (degrees) for
            device 1. It is determined from the beamx command
            and the patch (Mark III/IV) or bbc (VLBA/4) command.
            beam2      The full width half maximum beam size (degrees) for
            device 2. It is determined from the beamx command
            and the patch (Mark III/IV) or bbc (VLBA/4) command.
            flux1      The apparent source flux for device 1, based on the
            fluxx command and the patch (Mark III/IV) or bbc
            (VLBA/4) command.
            flux2      The apparent source flux for device 2, based on the
            fluxx command and the  patch (Mark III/IV) or bbc
            (VLBA/4) command.
          chain1   The IF chain, 1-6, that device 1 is on. Chains 5 and
          6 are for station specific detectors u5 and u6. Mark
          III/IV racks use IFs 1-3. IFs 1-4 corresponds to IFs
          a-d for VLBA/4 racks.
          chain2   The IF chain, 1-6, that device 2 is on. Chains 5 and
          6 are for station specific detectors u5 and u6. Mark
          III/IV racks use IFs 1-3. IFs 1-4 corresponds to IFs
          a-d for VLBA/4 racks.
                      
 Comments: 
 The parameters should be setup by issuing a onoff=  command. A
 measurement is started by issuing a simple onoff. This will
 recover the current values for the display only parameters and
 schedule an external program onoff. See the onoff manual in
 Volume 2.
 
 The current command antenna position including offsets is
 assumed to be 'onsource.'
 
 It is recommended that nothing else be done, e.g. running a
 schedule, while this command is executing. Since this command
 may run for an extended period of time, a mechanism has been
 supplied for aborting: enter sy=brk onoff & as a SNAP command.
 After aborting, the offsets will be returned to their original
 values.
 
 In order for this command to work, the following conditions
 must be met: (1) the detector devices have been set up by the
 Field System, (2) the appropriate lo=  commands have been
 issued, (3) the IF distributors have been set up by the Field
 System and it must be in remote (Mark III only), and (4) the
 appropriate beamx=  commands have been issued. Additionally,
 for a Mark III/IV rack, if  a video converter is used as a
 detector, the appropriate patch=  command must have been
 issued. For a VLBA/4 rack with a BBC as a detector, the
 appropriate BBC IF input must be selected with a bbcXX= 
 command. If system performance is to be estimated based on the
 source's apparent flux, then the appropriate fluxx=  command
 must have been issued.
 
 If a  noise diode temperature is less than zero, it is assumed
 that there is no noise diode to use for that detector. All
 measurements for that channel will be made assuming the
 absolute value of the diode temperature is the system
 temperature. Thus if the noise diode temperature is -100, the
 power measurements will come out as a percentage of the system
 temperature.
 
 If either noise diode temperature is greater than zero, then
 two procedures must be available: calonnf and caloffnf, which
 are used to turn the noise diode on and off respectively. The
 recommended form for these procedures is:
 
 CALONNF: calon
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff & 
 
 CALOFFNF:  caloff
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff & 
 
 calon and caloff are local procedures that do whatever is
 necessary to turn the noise source on and off, respectively. 
 
 If station dependent detectors u5 and/or u6 are used, two
 additional procedures must be available to turn the signal on
 and off to the detectors. The recommended form of this
 procedures is:
 
 SIGONNF: sigon
          !+1s 
          sy=go onoff &
 
 SIGOFFNF:  sigoff
          !+1s 
          sy=go onoff &
 
 sigon and sigoff are local procedures that do whatever is
 necessary to turn the signal to the station dependent
 detectors on and off, respectively.
 
 There is a known bug in the use of these procedures: calonnf,
 caloffnf, sigonnf, and sigoffnf,  that may require the last
 two lines to be repeated in each procedure. In other words
 after the first line, each procedure should contain:
 
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff &
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff &
 
 The indication that this is needed is if onoff seems to hang
 after executing one of these procedures. Please see the "Known
 Bugs" section of the latest update notice for more details.
