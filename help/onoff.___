Comments:
The parameters should be setup by issuing a onoff=...  command. A
measurement is started by issuing a simple onoff.  This will recover
the current values for the display only parameters and schedule the
external program "onoff". See the onoff manual in Volume 2 (currently
out-of-date).

The current command antenna position including offsets is assumed to
be 'onsource.'
 
It is recommended that nothing else be done, e.g., running a schedule,
while this command is executing. Since this command may run for an
extended period of time, a mechanism has been supplied for aborting:
enter "sy=brk onoff &" as a SNAP command.  After aborting, the offsets
will be returned to their original values.

In order for this command to work, the following conditions must be
met: (1) the detector device(s) (VCxx, BBCxx, IFDxx, IF3, IFx) have
been set up by the Field System, (2) the appropriate "lo=..." commands
have been issued, (3) the IF distributors have been set up by the
Field System (and must be in remote for Mark III/IV/5), (4) for a Mark
III/IV/5 and LBA4 racks only, if a video converter is used as a
detector, the appropriate "patch=..." command have been issued, and
(5) for a VLBA/4/5 and DBBC racks only, if a BBC is used as a
detector, the appropriate BBC IF input have be selected with a bbcXX=
command.

If a noise diode temperature is less than zero, it is assumed that
there is no noise diode to use for that detector. All measurements for
that detector will be made assuming the absolute value of the diode
temperature is the system temperature. Thus if the noise diode
temperature is -100 (a useful choice), the power measurements will
come out as a percentage of the system temperature. Other quantities
dependent on the noise diode will be displayed as 0.0.

If either noise diode temperature is greater than zero, then two
procedures must be available: calonnf and caloffnf, which are used to
turn the noise diode on and off respectively. The recommended form for
these procedures is:

CALONNF:  calon
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff & 

CALOFFNF: caloff
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff & 

calon and caloff are local procedures that do whatever is necessary to
turn the noise source on and off, respectively.

If station dependent detectors u5 and/or u6 are used, two additional
procedures must be available to turn the signal on and off to the
detectors. The recommended form of this procedures is:

SIGONNF:  sigon
          !+1s 
          sy=go onoff &

SIGOFFNF: sigoff
          !+1s 
          sy=go onoff &

sigon and sigoff are local procedures that do whatever is necessary to
turn the signal to the station dependent detectors on and off,
respectively.  The signal needs to be turned off to determine the
"zero" signal level.

There is a known bug in the use of these procedures: calonnf,
caloffnf, sigonnf, and sigoffnf, that may require the last two lines
to be repeated in each procedure. In other words after the first line,
each procedure should contain:

          !+1s
          sy=go onoff &
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff &

The indication that this is needed is if onoff seems to hang after
executing one of these procedures. Please see the "Known Bugs" section
of the latest update notice for more details.

The "formbbc", "formif", and "formvc" detector device parameters will
cause the BBCs, IFs, or VCs (respectively) that are current defined
for recording by the formatter to be selected as detectors. This is
useful for checking SEFDs in all channels to be used in an experiment
when the rack has been set-up in the configration of the experiment.

The default wait time for of 120 seconds is generous, but can be
adjusted if necessary. Slower antennas may need a longer time. Shorter
times are only useful to make onoff give-up sooner if there is a
problem getting on-source.

If continous cal is in use ("cont_cal=on,..."), the noise diode
temperature is expected to be a small fraction of Tsys, a few percent.
Consequently, it may be necessary to take a large number of samples
beat the noise level down enough to get reliable gain compression
results and to calibrate the noise diode. However, SEFD measurements
should only be about 41% noisier than when the same integration is
used with non-continuous calibration is used.

If "proc" in non-null, it is the 'base' name for a user defined SNAP
procedure, referred to hereafter as the measurement SNAP procedure,
that will be executed for the first on-source and off-source
points. Typically this procedure would be used to control other user
organized measurement systems while ONOFF is running. In addition, an
initialization SNAP procedure, using the 'base' name, is run after the
antenna is initially onsource before the first measurement.

The name of initialization procedure is constructed from the 'base'
name specified by "proc" with an "i" appended. When executed, it is
passed an argument, described farther below.  This procedure might be
used to initialize the set-up of a device. e.g., an Agilenet N9020A
Signal Analyzer, prior to the use of the corresponding ("proc"+"p")
measurement procedure. The following is a sample procedure , "onoffi"
("onoff"+"i") using this analyzer (HPIB device "SA", defined in
"ibad.ctl"):

ONOFFI:   hpib=sa,...
          sy=go onoff & 
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff & 

The "..." would be replaced with an appropriate initialization string,
possibly including the procedures argument (represented by "$").

The measurement SNAP procedure is run for, only, the first on-source
and the first off-source point. Its name is constructed from the base
name ("proc") with a "p" appended. The following is an example of a
measurement procedure, "onoffp" ("onoff"+"p"), that might be useful,
e.g., with a broad-band power measurement using an Agilenet N9020A
Signal Analyzer. It uses the analyzer (HPIB device "SA", defined in
"ibad.ctl") to store a power spectrum in an appropriately named file.

ONOFFP:   hpib=sa,trac:type aver
          !+18s
          hpib=sa,mmem:stor:trac:data trace1,"$.csv"
          sy=go onoff &
          !+1s
          sy=go onoff &

Each time they are run, the initialization and meaurement procedures
are given an argument in the form:

  ssssssssssxaaaAeeEyyYdddDhhHmmM

where:

 ssssssssss is the source name with (trailing) blanks replaced with
            underscores ("_")
 x          is "N" for the on-source point, "F" for the off-source point,
            "I" for the initialization procedure
 aaa        is the current azimuth in degrees
 ee         is the current elevation in degrees
 yy         is the year modulo 100
 ddd        is the day of year
 hh         is the hour
 mm         is the minutes.

Except for the "F", "I", or "N", the argument has the same value for
the on and off source points and initialization. Note that the FS will
convert this argument to all lower-case when it processes the
command. This argument can be used in the procedures by specifying a
dollar sign "$" where it should be used.
