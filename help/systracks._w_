       systracks - system track set-up (VLBA, VLBA4 drives)

            Syntax:     systracks=st0,st1,st34,st35

            Response:   systracks/st0,st1,st34,st35


Settable parameters:
        stX     The recorder track that will have its output from the
        formatter placed on recorder track X, where X is one
        of the system tracks: 0, 1, 34, or 35. Default is
        itself, i.e., for st0 the default is 0, for st1 the default is 1,
        for st34 the default is 34, and for st35 the default is
        35.

Comments: 
This command is used to define what data will be recorded on
the system tracks. This can be used to duplicate data from one
of the normal data tracks if that track has failed. Under
Field System control, the formatter will not normally send any
data to the system tracks, therefore if the default is used
for any parameter's value, normally no data will be written to
that track.
