Monitor-only Parameters: none

Comments:
This command specifies the characteristics for user (station)
detectors 1 and 2 for use with Tsys, Fivept, and Onoff commands.

User detectors 1 and 2 are know as "u5" and "u6" respectively
because they are associated with fictitious IF channels 5 and 6. The
user_device command defines the charateristics of the IF for these
channels and also the center frequency of the detectors in each IF
channel. Please note this is the IF center frequency of the detector,
not the sky center frequency.

This command is roughly equivalent to the LO command but covers the
fictitious IF channels 5 and 6.  It provides the necessary information
for the station detectors to be used with normal Tsys and pointing and
gain calibration tools in the FS. However, please note that "u5" and
"u6" cannot be used for Tsys measurements if the rack type is Mark 3,
Mark IV, VLBA, VLBA4, LBA, or LBA4. They can however be used for
Fivept and Onoff regardless of the rack type. There may be issues with
the implementation for LBA racks, but they are not supported at this
time anyway.

The "zero" parameter specifies whether measuring the "no signal" level
of the device can be measured under FS control, for example using the
"sigoff" and "sigon" procedures described in the FIVEPT and ONOFF help
pages.  Detectors need to have their zero level measured if the their
no signal level is a significant fraction, say greater than 1%, of the
normal Tsys level.  Typically analog detectors need to have the level
measured, but digital detectors do not.  The zero level is basically a
bias in the measurements; a negative bias (which appears as zero) is
not a way around the need to measure the level.  However a small bias
may be tolerable. An uncorrected 1% bias makes a 1% error in the
measured Tsys level.  If "no" is selected, there is no need to measure
"tpzero" when measuring Tsys (typically in the "caltsys" procedure).
Further if "tpzero" is measured in this case, the value is ignored.

An user_device= with no parameters clears all user_device values.

The monitor form of user_device shows all defined user_device values.
