           bank_check - Mark 5A recording bank check

            Syntax:     bank_check

            Response:   bank_check/VSN


Monitor-only parameters:
            VSN     Volume serial number of bank to be recorded

Comments:
This command will check the VSN. If it has changed or hasn't been
logged since the current log file was last opened, it will be logged.

If the active drive type is "mk5a_bs", this command will check the
remaining record time on the current bank and if the next scan will
not fit, it will switch banks before checking the VSN.
