           bank_check - Mark 5A recording bank check

            Syntax:     bank_check

            Response:   bank_check/VSN,serial1,...serialN


Monitor-only parameters:
            VSN     Volume serial number of bank to be recorded
            serialX the serial number of the Xth disk in this volume

Comments:
This command will check the VSN of active bank. If it has changed or
hasn't been logged since the current log file was last opened, it will
be logged along with the disk serial numbers.

If the active drive type is "mk5a_bs", this command will check the
remaining record time on the current bank and if the next scan (or
continuous recording) will not fit, it will switch banks. If the bank
is switched and the new bank also does not have enough room for the
next scan (or continuous recording), the bank will be switched again
to return to the original bank. If the bank is switched (once or
twice) the VSN and disk serial numbers in the final bank will be
logged unconditionally.

bank_check determines whether the next scan or continuous recording
will fit by comparing the recording time remaining on the current bank
with the length of the scan and continuous recording specified by the
last scan_name=... command. If the required capacity is greater than five
seconds less than remaining capacity, the bank will switched.
