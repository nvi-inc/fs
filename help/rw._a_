                  rw - rewind tape (all drives)

Syntax:     rw

Response:   rw/acknowledgement


Settable Parameters: none

Comments: 
The tape is moved in reverse at high speed. For Mark III, the
record bit is disabled and the low tape sensor is turned on. For
VLBA, all track groups are disabled and the low tape sensor is
turned on.

The tape is moved at the "schedule" value as specified in the
equip.ctl control file. This is the speed assumed in the SNAP
schedule file for positioning the tape with the fastr procedure.

Use the srw command and sfastr procedure for possibly faster tape
motion.
