                source - source name and position

Syntax:     source=name,ra,dec,epoch,wrap

Response:   source/name,ra,dec,epoch,wrap,ranow,decnow,now


Settable parameters:
name    Source name, up to 10 characters. No default. Special
        source names are recognized by many antenna interface
        programs. Some names and their meaning are:
     azeltrue corrected coordinates
   azeluncrencoder units
      xyencoder units
    Other specialized names are described in the comments
    below. If name is sun or moon, no position or epoch is
    required, and if given it will be ignored.
ra      Right ascension, in numeric angle/hours format. No default.
        If name is azel or azeluncr, this parameter is interpreted
        as an azimuth. If name is xy, this parameter is interpreted
        as an X position.
dec     Declination, in numeric angle/degrees format. No default.
        If name is azel or azeluncr, this parameter is interpreted
        as an elevation. If name is xy, this parameter is
        interpreted as an Y position.
epoch   Epoch in years. Default 1950.0. This field is checked only
        if the specified angles are right ascension and
        declination. A value of -1 inhibits reduction of
        coordinates, i.e., they are assumed to be topocentric.
wrap    neutral, ccw (counter-clockwise), cw (clockwise), or null
        to indicate which wrap (or no specific one) the antenna
        should be on for this source. The local antenna may or may
        not respect this parameter.

Monitor-only parameters:
ranow   Topocentric right ascension for when the source was
        commanded
decnow  Topocentric declination for when the source was commanded
now     Approximate epoch of these coordinates

Comments: 
The antenna will begin moving to the new source when this command
is issued. At some antennas, if the source name is given as azel or
azeluncr, then the ra and dec are recognized as azimuth and
elevation in degrees; if the source name is xy, then the next two
fields are recognized as x and y in degrees. If the source name is
sun or moon, the appropriate coordinates will be calculated by the
Field System based on the current time and the site position as
specified in the location.ctl file.

Issuing a source=... command will invalidate the calculated values
for the fluxn= commands. To indicate this their values are set to
negative numbers.

Typical interpretations of special names may or may not be
supported at any given station. These are typical meanings:

  stow      Pre-defined stow position.
  service   Pre-defined service position.
  disable   Stops antenna communications. This is useful to stop
            error messages when here is a problem.
  idle      Monitor the antenna position, but do not command it.
            This is the normal start-up state for the Field
            System.
  hold      Maintain the current antenna position.

The wrap parameter is usually provided by drudg in SNAP schedules
for AZEL antennas for the information of the operator in selecting
the correct wrap for a source when a schedule is started or has to
be re-started. Most antenna interfaces do enforce this.

The topocentric place for sources other than the Sun and Moon is
calculated using USNO's NOVAS routines. As used here, the results
should be accurate to better than 10 milli-arc-seconds for the time
that the source is commanded. The effects of light bending and
diurnal aberration are included. For the effect of diurnal
aberration (typically less than about 0.3 arc-seconds in magnitude)
to be calculated accurately the position of the antenna in
location.ctl must be fairly accurate.

If the input epoch is 2000.0, the input coordinates are reduced
using standard IAU precession and nutation models, plus light
bending and aberration (annual and diurnal) to yield topocentric
coordinates. If the input epoch is 1950.0, then the input
coordinates are rotated to 2000.0 using the  inverse of the
rotation used by drudg to rotate from 2000.0 to 1950.0, then they
are reduced to topocentric. In schedules, this has the effect of
making the calculated topocentric place of a source that has mean
coordinates of J2000 in the .drg or .skd schedule file independent
of whether drudg puts 2000.0 or 1950.0 coordinates in the .snp file
(to the precision used by drudg in the .snp) file. For coordinates
of other epochs, the coordinates are assumed to be apparent (no
diurnal aberration) and are reduced back to 2000.0 using the full
theory and then reduced to topocentric.

For the Sun and Moon, the topocentric place is calculated to lower
precision than other sources since these are large sources and are
generally only used for calibrating small antennas with large
beams.
