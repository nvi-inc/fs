	source - source name and position

Syntax:			source=name,ra,dec,epoch

Response:		source/name,ra,dec,epoch,ranow,decnow,today


Settable parameters:
name		Source name, up to 10 characters. No default. Special source names are recognized by many antenna interface programs. Some names and their meaning are:
						azel			true corrected coordinates
						azeluncr	encoder units
						xy				encoder units
				Other specialized names are described in the comments below. If name is sun or moon, no position is required, and if given it will be ignored.
ra			Right ascension, in numeric angle/hours format. No default. If name is azel or azeluncr, this parameter is interpreted as an azimuth. If name is xy, this parameter is interpreted as an X position.
dec			Declination, in numeric angle/degrees format. No default. If name is azel or azeluncr, this parameter is interpreted as an elevation. If name is xy, this parameter is interpreted as an Y position.
epoch		Epoch in years. Default 1950.0. This field is checked only if the specified angles are right ascension and declination. A value of -1 inhibits precession.

Monitor-only parameters:
ranow		Right ascension precessed to today's date.
decnow	Declination precessed to today's date.
today		Epoch of precession.

Comments: 
The antenna will begin moving to the new source when this command is issued. At some antennas, if the source name is given as azel or azeluncr, then the ra and dec are recognized as azimuth and elevation in degrees; if the source name is xy, then the next two fields are recognized as x and y in degrees. If the source name is sun or moon, the appropriate coordinates will be calculated by the Field System based on the current time and the site position as specified in the location.ctl file.

Issuing a source=... command will invalidate the calculated values for the fluxn= commands. To indicate this their values are set to negative numbers.

Typical interpretations of special names may or may not be supported at any given station. These are typical meanings:

		stow			Pre-defined stow position.
		service		Pre-defined service position.
		disable		Stops antenna communications. This is useful to stop error messages when here is a problem.
		idle			Monitor the antenna position, but do not command it. This is the normal start-up state for the Field System.
		hold			Maintain the current antenna position.
