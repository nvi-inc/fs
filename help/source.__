source - source name and position
Syntax:      source=name,ra,dec,epoch

Response:    source/name,ra,dec,epoch,ranow,decn
             ow,today


Settable parameters:
name            source name, up to 10 characters. No default. If
                name is sun or moon, no position is required
                (if given, it will be ignored).
ra              right ascension, in numeric angle/hours format.
                No default.
dec             declination, in numeric angle/degrees format. No
                default.
epoch           epoch in years. Default 1950.0.

Monitor-only parameters:
ranow           right ascension precessed to today's date.
decnow          declination precessed to today's date.
today           epoch of precession.

Comments: 
The antenna will begin moving to the new source when this
command is issued. At some antennas, if the source name is given
as azel, then the ra and dec are recognized as azimuth and
elevation in degrees; if the source name is xy, then the next two
fields are recognized as x and y in degrees. If the source name is
sun or moon, the appropriate coordinates will be calculated by
the Field System based on the time of the computer clock and the
site position as specified in the location.ctl file.

Issuing a source=... command will invalidate the calculated
values for the fluxn= commands. To indicate this their values
are set to negative numbers.
