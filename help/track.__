Settable Parameters:  none

Monitor-only parameters:

The tr line contains information from the tracking computer (all
angles are in degrees):
yy/ddd.hh:m:ss  year day and time of tracking computer
cmd1          first antenna command angle, x, azimuth, or hour
              angle
cmd2          second antenna command angle, y, elevation, or
              declination
delta1        tracking error for first command angle
delta2        tracking error for second command angle

The pr line contains predicted command angles based on time in tr
line (all angles are in degrees):
prd1          predicted first command angle
prd2          predicted second command angle
praz          predicted azimuth
prel          predicted elevation

The co line contains calculated correction information (all angles
are in degrees):
cor1          pointing correction for first command angle
cor2          pointing correction for second command angle
eqeq          approximate Equation of the Equinoxes, seconds of
              time
refr          refraction correction

Comments: 
This command is implemented as a special mode of antcn, which may
not be available at all stations. The format of the output is
station dependent and may differ, some entries may be missing, and
there may be additional entries.  This output is normally produced
by antcn and each entry will begin with #antcn#.

The typical tr line is intended to display information about the
tracking computer. The time, command angles, and deltas normally
all refer to the same epoch and the deltas are displayed with the
sign of command minus actual.  The time can be compared roughly to
the time field of the log entry.

The typical pr line contains the command angles and azimuth and
elevation that antcn would have predicted at the time in the tr
line. These angles can be compared to those in tr. If antcn
faithfully replicates the command angle calculation of the pointing
computer, the numbers should agree well.  At some stations this may
only be approximate. Some stations may not have this line if the
command angles are calculated in the same computer as the Field
System runs in.

The typical co line contains the pointing corrections that
correspond to the current predicted command angles. The cor1 and cor2
fields are the pointing model corrections for the two angles. The
eqeq field is the equation of the equinoxes which is a small
correction to sidereal time. The refr value gives the refraction
correction for the current command angles.

Additional lines of locally defined information may be displayed.
