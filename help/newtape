NEWTAPE - Halt schedule until new tape is mounted

Syntax:   NEWTAPE
Response: NEWTAPE/"To continue, use LABEL command"

      Comments: This command in effect is the same as the HALT
command. Execution will continue after the LABEL command has been
successfully completed. The CONT command will also work.
