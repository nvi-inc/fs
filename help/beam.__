beam - set beamsize for flux command
Syntax:      beam1=angle
             beam2=angle
             beama=angle
             beamb=angle

Response:    beam1/angle
             beam2/angle
             beama/angle
             beamb/angle


Settable parameters:
angle           full-width half maximum beam size, displayed in
                decimal degrees of arc.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments:
The beam1/beam2 and beama/beamb commands are applicable for
Mark III and VLBA systems, respectively. The two command pairs,
beam1/beama and beam2/beamb are synonomous.

Two beam sizes may be specified with these two commands. Normally IF
channels 1 and 2 (Mark III) and IF channels A and B (VLBA) correspond
to the two beam sizes. The commands flux1/flux2 and
fluxa/fluxb use the sizes specified as beam1/beam2 and
beama/beamb respectively.

There is no default for the beam size unless the appropriate IF distributor
command (ifd for Mark III systems, ifab or ifcd for VLBA systems)
and the lo and upconv commands have been issued. If these commands
have been issued, then the beam size will default to the beam size
calculated from the appropriate LO and upconverter frequencies and the
antenna diameter found in the antenna.ctl control file. The formula is:

            beam size (radians) = 1.05*c/(freq*diaman)

Issuing a beamx=... command will change the calculated values of the
fluxx command to invalid quantities. Reissue a corrrect fluxx=...
command to recalculate fluxes.
