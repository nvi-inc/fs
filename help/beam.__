               beam - set beamsize for flux command

Syntax:     beam1=angle
  beam2=angle
  beam3=angle
  beama=angle
  beamb=angle
  beamc=angle
  beamd=angle

Response:   beam1/angle
  beam2/angle
  beam3/angle
  beama/angle
  beamb/angle
  beamc/angle
  beamd/angle


Settable parameters:
angle     full-width half maximum beam size, displayed in decimal
          degrees of arc.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments:
The beam1/2/3 and beama/b/c/d commands are applicable for Mark III
and VLBA systems, respectively. The command pairs beam1/a, beam2/b,
and beam3/c are synonomous.

The beam size for the sky frequency for each IF channel may be
specified with these commands. The commands flux1/2/3 and
fluxa/b/c/d use the sizes specified as beam1/2/3 and beama/b/c/d,
respectively, to calculate the apparent flux.

There is no default for the beam size unless the appropriate IF
distributor command (ifd or if3 for Mark III systems, ifab or ifcd
for VLBA systems) and the lo and upconv commands have been issued.
If these commands have been issued, then the beam size will default
to the beam size calculated from the appropriate LO and upconverter
frequencies and the antenna diameter found in the antenna.ctl
control file. The formula is:

            beam size (radians) = 1.05*c/(freq*diaman)

Issuing a beamx=... command will change the calculated values of
the fluxx command to invalid quantities. Reissue a corrrect
fluxx=... command to recalculate fluxes.
