fivept - five or more point source scan
Syntax:      fivept=axis,rep,pts,stp,intp,dev

Response:    fivept/axis,rep,pts,stp,intp,dev,
             cal,beam,flux


Settable parameters:
axis            Axis system for scan. 
                   hadc = Hour Angle/Declination
                   (default)
                   azel = Azimuth/Elevation
                   xyns = X/Y, +X East
                   xyew = X/Y, +X South  (unimplemented)
rep             number of repetitions: -10 to -1 and 1 to 10
                allowed. Default is -2. Negative repetition
                counts are described in the fivpt manual.
pts             number of points on each axis, if even, it is
                increased by 1. pts must be between 3 and 31.
                Default is 7. 
stp             Step size for distance between points, in
                multiples of a beamwidth. Default is 0.5. 
intp            integration period, 1 to 10 seconds.
dev             mnemonic for the device to be used as the
                detector. Standard devices are allowed. Note that
                for Mark III equipment, the video converter USB
                or LSB was set up with the vc command. The
                module which has the specified detector  must
                have been set up. The IF distributor must be set
                up and, for Mark III, must be in remote. Default
                detector is i1 for Mark III, ia for VLBA.

Display-only parameters:
cal             calibration noise source temperature in degrees
                K. This is determined from the last caltempx
                commands in conjunction with the patch (Mark
                III) or bbc (VLBA) command for the specified
                device.
beam            The full width half maximum beam size degrees.
                This is determined from the last beamx
                commands in conjunction with the patch (Mark
                III) or bbc command.
flux            The apparent flux of the source. This is
                determined from the last fluxx commands in
                conjunction with the patch command.

Comments: 
The parameters should be setup with a fivept=... command.
A scan is started by issuing a simple fivept command (i.e. with
no parameters), this will determine the current values of the
display only parameters and then schedule an external program,
fivpt, which then uses the Field System to perform the necessary
measurements. fivpt must be included in the fspgm.ctl control file
so that it will automatically be initialized when the Field System
is started. See the fivept manual in Volume 2.

The scan is performed about the current commanded position. Any
offsets that are in use are included. If the scan is successful the
total offsets for the selected axis type are updated.

It is recommended that nothing else be done, e.g. running a
schedule, while this command is executing. Since this command
may run for an extended period of time, a mechanism has been
supplied for aborting: enter sy=br fivpt. The program will
then return the antenna to the last good offset for each axis. If
there was no good offset measurement on an axis, then the original
offset is used.

In order for this command to work, the following conditions must
be met: (1) the detector device have been setup by the Field
System, (2) the lo and upconv commands have been issued, (3)
the IF distributor has been setup by the Field System and is in
remote (Mark III only), (4) the appropriate beamx=... and
caltempx=.... must have been issued. If a Mark III video
converter is used as the detector then the patch command must
have been issued as well. If estimates of performance based on the
source flux are desired, then the appropriate fluxx=...
command must have been issued as well.

Two procedures must be available: calonfp and calofffp,
which are used by fivpt to turn the noise diode on and off
respectively. The recommended form for these procedures is:

CALONFP:     CALON
             !+1S 

CALOFFFP:    CALOFF
             !+1S 

calon and caloff are local procedures that do whatever is
necessary to turn the noise source on and off.
