HDCALC - Narrow Track Head Calibration Calculation

Syntax:   HDCALC
          HDCALC=CLEAR
Response: HDCALC/<writeF>,<readF>,<writeR>,<readR>,<writeS>,<readS>

Settable parameters:
none, however HDCALC=CLEAR will delete previously calculated values

Monitor-only parameters:
<writeF>: Forward absolute offset for the write head
<readF>: Forward absolute offset for the read head
<writeR>: Reverse relative offset for the write head
<readR>: Reverse relative offset for the read head
<writeS>: Write head scale
<readS>: Read head scale

Comments: This command will calculate new calibration parameters based
on the voltages saved with the SAVEV command. See the Narrow-Track
Calibration Guide for a description of the calculations. Only one
scale factor is calculated for each head.

Any parameters which cannot be calculated because SAVEV has not saved
a complete set of voltages will be reported as NULL, i.e. empty.
