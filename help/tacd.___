             tacd - Totally Accurate Clock (TAC) data

Syntax:     tacd=action
          tacd

Response:   tacd/status,host,port,file,state
          tacd/time,age,ddddd.ffffff,ss,aa,g.ggg.c.cccc,t.tttt
          tacd/average,age,ddddd.ffffff,sec,rms,max,min,average


Settable Parameters:
action      A key word specifying what you want from the TAC:
            status  Return TAC status, also ?.
            time    Return time.
            average Return average counters. 
            cont    Retrieve information from TAC every 100
                    centiseconds.
            stop    Stop tacd from connecting to the TAC and stop
                    giving errors.
            start   Undo the stop command, and does a restart.
          Default (null) is to undo the effect of cont command.

Monitor-only Parameter:
status:
host    Computer that is hosting the TAC.
port      IP port being used to connect to TAC.
file      Name of the file being used to on host to record
          measurements.
state   Status of file (open or closed).
time:
age     OLD or NEW result. OLD indicates a previously logged
        result.
ddddd.fffff The ddddd field may be yyddd or MJD or Excel date (days
            since 1900.0). The ffffff field is always the time in
            fractions of a day.
ss      ONCORE receiver's ñ 52 nanosecond sawtooth correction to
        the GPS 1PPS (nanoseconds).
aa      An estimate of the accuracy of the GPS tick
        (nanoseconds).
g.ggg   Amount by which the GPS receiver's 1PPS output has been
        intentionally biased (microseconds).
c.cccc    Corrected (cooked) counter reading after applying the ss
          and g.ggg corrections (microseconds).
t.tttt      Raw counter reading (microseconds).
average:
age     OLD or NEW result. OLD indicates a previously logged
        result.
ddddd.fffff The ddddd field may be yyddd or MJD or Excel date (days
            since 1900.0). The ffffff field is always the time in
            fractions of a day.
sec     Number of seconds of data going into average.
rms     RMS scatter of the sec data points about the average
        (microseconds).
max   The extreme maximum of the sec points (microseconds).
min     The extreme minimum of the sec points
        (microseconds).Comments: 
average Average counter reading (microseconds).

Comments:
A simple tacd command (with no =) causes either the current raw
or current averaged measurement, depending on the last set-up of
the tacd command, to be logged. If the command has not been set-
up previously, a raw measurement is logged.

Since the time and average output records can contain values
previously logged, values of OLD or NEW for age are used to
distinguish previously logged and new results. This is intended
to assist in identifying independent measurements for plotting
(use NEW as the string in logpl).

It will startup with the Field System the tacd program gets the
host and port assignment from the tacd.ctl control file. If no
control file is available it will give a one time error and not
attempt to open any host connections. If a control file is
available and is empty tacd will sleep until a control file is
provided and a start command is issued. If the file is not empty
it will attempt to establish connection and then retrieve data
every 30 seconds. If connection fails, it will keep on trying
every 30 seconds until a connection is made.

The contents of file on the TAC host may contain averaged or un-
averaged data depending on the set-up of the TAC.
