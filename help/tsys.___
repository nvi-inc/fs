             tsys - compute and display system temps

            Syntax:     tsys=list

            Response:   tsys/systemps


Settable parameters:

            list        List of modules for which Tsys will be computed.
                        Standard detector mnemonics allowed.  In
                        addition: for VLBA/4/5/DBBC 'formif' and
                        'formbbc' are permitted; for Mark III/IV/5,
                        'formif' and 'formvc' are permitted; station
                        detectors 'u5' and 'u6' are permitted.

Monitor-only parameters:

            systemps    List of detector & system temperature pairs.
                        Temperatures are in degrees Kelvin.

Comments: 

The results are returned grouped in pairs of 'mnemonic,value' for each
detector.  The output is collected into lines by IF channel.
Detectors that have no IF assigned are displayed first followed by
those for IFs '1'-'3' (Mark III/IV) or 'a'-'d' (VLBA/4/5/DBBC).  If
the output for an IF would make a long output line, the output is
split into more than one line.  For station detectors, the values are
displayed on one line.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the VCs are
displayed as 'hs', where 'h' is the VC number as hex and 's' is for
the sideband: 'd' (dual for upper/lower), 'u' (upper), 'l' (lower), a
digit '3'-'7' for other VC detectors or 'x' for unknown.

For VLBA/4/5/DBBC, additional mnemonics 'formif' and 'formbbc' are
permitted in the 'list'.  These select the detectors for the IF
channels and BBC sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter.
For Mark III/IV/5, 'formvc' is accepted instead of 'formbbc', as well
as 'formif'.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark III/IV/5,
LBA, VLBA/4/5 or DBBC detector will not prevent results from other
detectors from being displayed.  A negative integer will be shown for
each channel that had an error that prevented an actual measurement
from being displayed.  An overflow value, larger than 999999.9 is
displayed as dollar signs, '$$$$$$$$'.

This command calculates and displays system temperatures for the
different detectors.  The formula for Mark III/IV/5, LBA4, DBBC, and
station detectors is:
 
            tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/tpdiff)

For LBA and DBBC the formula is:

                 tsys = tpi * (caltemp/tpdiff)

For VLBA/4/5 the formula is:

      tsys = (tpi/(tpgain*tpgain) -
              tpzero/(tpdiffgain*tpdiffgain))
            * (caltemp/(tpdiff/(tpdiffgain*tpdiffgain)))
 
where:

  tsys          system temperature, as reported in 'tsys' command
  tpi           cal-off reading, from 'tpi' command
  tpzero        zero-level reading, from 'tpzero' command
  tpical        cal-on reading, from tpical command
  caltemp       noise calibration source temperature, from
                'caltemp' command.
  tpgain        VLBA 'tpi' gain reading, from 'tpgain' command
  tpdiff        'tpical'-'tpi' value, from 'tpdiff' command
  tpdiffgain    VLBA 'tpdiff' gain reading, from 'tpdiffgain' command

For VLBA/4/5 'tpgain' must be a measurement of the gain level when
'tpi' (often independent of the 'tpi' used for 'tpdiff') is measured
and likewise 'tpdiffgain' must be a measurement of the gain level when
'tpzero' and 'tpdiff' are measured.  However, if 'tpgain' and/or
'tpdiffgain' return incorrect values when used because of some
persistant problem, they can be omitted as long as the gain level is
the same for all of 'tpi', 'tpzero', and 'tpdiff'.

The 'tpi' value used for 'tpdiff' may be different from the 'tpi'
values used for 'tsys'.  The 'tpdiff' is used to define the conversion
factor from counts to degrees (according to 'caltemp') only.
Subsequent 'tpi' values can be used to track variations in the system
temperature.  Please see the default 'caltsys', 'preob', and 'midob'
procedures for examples of how Tsys is measured.

For station detectors, if the 'zero' parameter in the 'user_device'
command, is set to 'no', the value of tpzero is assumed to be
zero. Any measured 'tpzero' value is ignored in this case.
