             tsys - compute and display system temps
 
              Syntax:      tsys=list
          tsys5=list
          tsys6=list
 
              Response:    tsys/systemps
          tsys5/systemps
          tsys6/systemps
 
 
 Settable parameters:
            list       List of modules for which Tsys will be computed.
            Standard mnemonics allowed.
 
 Monitor-only parameters:
            systemps   List of system temperatures, computed from values
            retrieved by the tpi, tpical, and tpzero commands.
            -1.0 means no caltemp could be found for this
            detector.
 
 Comments: 
 This command calculates and displays system temperatures for
 the different video and IF channels.The formula is:
 
          tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/(tpical-tpi))
 
 tsys         system temperature, as reported in tsys command
              tpi          cal-off reading, from tpi command
              tpzero       zero-level reading, from tpzero command
              tpical       cal-on reading, from tpical command
                caltemp        noise calibration source temperature, from
                caltemp command.
 
 Except for station defined detectors, the results are returned
 grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value, the output is
 collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have no IF
 assigned are displayed first followed by Ifs 1-3 (Mark III/IV)
 and a-d (VLBA/VLBA4). If the output for an IF would make a
 long output line, the output is split into more than one line.
 For station defined detectors the results are just displayed
 in order: u5, u6.
 
 A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark
 III/IV or VLBA/VLBA4 detector will not prevent results from
 other detectors from being displayed. A negative integer will
 be shown for each channel that had an error that prevented an
 actual measurement from being displayed. An overflow value,
 larger than 999999.9 is displayed as dollar signs, $$$$$$$$.
 
 For Mark III/IV racks the detector mnemonics for the VC are
 displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s is for
 the detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u (upper), l
 (lower), or a digit 4-7 for other detectors.
 
 For station dependent detectors, the tsys5 and tsys6 commands
 are used to match the detectors to the corresponding caltemp5
 and caltemp6.
