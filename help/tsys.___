Settable parameters:
list        List of modules for which Tsys will be computed.
            Standard mnemonics allowed.

Monitor-only parameters:
systemps    List of system temperatures, computed from values
            retrieved by the tpi, tpical, and tpzero commands.
            -1.0 means no current measurements available.

Comments: 
This command calculates and displays system temperatures for the
different video and IF channels. The command pairs, tsys1/a,
tsys2/b, and tsys3/c are synonymous. The calculations for the
tsys1/2/3 and tsysa/b/c/d commands use the noise calibration
values specified in the caltemp1/2/3 and caltempa/b/c/d commands,
respectively. The formula is:

          tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/(tpical-tpi))

tsys          system temperature, as reported in tsys command
tpi         cal-off reading, from tpi command
tpzero        zero-level reading, from tpzero command
tpical        cal-on reading, from tpical command
caltemp       noise calibration source temperature, from caltemp
              command.

For Mark III/IV racks, either USB or LSB system temperature is
computed and displayed, depending on the last-measured values for
the total power.

For Mark III/IV racks, the readings are listed from the selected
detectors in the order: VC01-VC14, IF1, IF2, IF3. For VLBA racks,
the readings are listed from the selected detectors in the order:
Lower Side Band: BBC01-BBC14, Upper Side Band: BBC01-BBC14, IFA,
IFB, IFC, IFD.
