             tsys - compute and display system temps

            Syntax:     tsys=list
                        tsys5=list
                        tsys6=list

            Response:   tsys/systemps
                        tsys5/systemps
                        tsys6/systemps


Settable parameters:
            list        List of modules for which Tsys will be computed.
                        Standard mnemonics allowed. In addition: for VLBA/4/5
                        and DBBC formif and formbbc are permitted;
                        for Mark III/IV/5 formif and formvc are permitted.

Monitor-only parameters:
            systemps    List of system temperatures paired with the
                        corresponding detector mnemonics. Computed from
                        values retrieved by the tpi, tpical, tpzero,
                        tpdiff, tpgain, tpidiffgain ,and caltemp commands
                        as needed.  -1.0 means no caltemp value could be
                        found for this detector.

Comments: 
This command calculates and displays system temperatures for
the different video and IF channels.  The formula for Mark
III/IV and  LBA4 is:
 
            tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/tpdiff)

For LBA and DBBC the formula is:

                 tsys = tpi * (caltemp/tpdiff)

For VLBA/4 the formula is:

      tsys = (tpi/(tpgain*tpgain) -
              tpzero/(tpdiffgain*tpdiffgain))
            * (caltemp/(tpdiff/(tpdiffgain*tpdiffgain)))
 
For station specific detectors, the formula is

          tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/(tpical-tpi))

where:
tsys          system temperature, as reported in tsys command
tpi           cal-off reading, from tpi command
tpzero        zero-level reading, from tpzero command
tpical        cal-on reading, from tpical command
caltemp       noise calibration source temperature, from
              caltemp command.
 tpgain       VLBA TPI gain reading, from tpgain command
 tpdiff       TPICAL-TPI reading, from tpdiff command
 tpdiffgain   VLBA TPDIFF gain reading, from tpdiffgain
              command

For VLBA/4/5 tpgain must be a measurement of the gain level 
when tpi is measured and likewise tpdiffgain must be a
measurement of the gain level when tpzero and tpdiff are
measured. However, if tpgain  and/or tpidffgain return
incorrect values when used because of some problem, they  can
be omitted as long as the gain level is the same for all of
tpi, tpzero, and tpdiff.

Except for station specific detectors, the tpi value used for
tpidff may be different from the tpi values used for tsys. The
tpidiff is used to define the conversion factor from counts to
degrees (according to caltemp) only. Please see the default
CALTSYS, PREOB, and MIDOB procedures for examples of how TSYS
is used.

Except for station defined detectors, the results are returned
grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value, the output is
collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have no IF
assigned are displayed first followed by Ifs 1-3 (Mark III/IV
and LBA4), 1-4 (LBA), and a-d (VLBA/4). If the output for an
IF would make a long output line, the output is split into
more than one line. For station defined detectors, accessed by
the tsys5 and tsys6 commands, the results are just displayed
in order: u5, u6.

For Mark III/IV5 and LBA, additional mnemonics formif and formvc are
permitted in the list. These select the detectors for the IF channels
and VC sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter. For VC
detectors, the appropriate sideband or sideband combination must be
already selected for the device.

For VLBA/4/5 and DBBC, additional mnemonics formif and formbbcc are
permitted in the list. These select the detectors for the IF channels
and BBC sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark III/IV/5,
LBA, VLBA/4/5 or DBBC detector will not prevent results from other
detectors from being displayed. A negative integer will be shown for
each channel that had an error that prevented an actual measurement
from being displayed. An overflow value, larger than 999999.9 is
displayed as dollar signs, $$$$$$$$.

For Mark III/IV/5 and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the
VCs are displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s
is for the detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u
(upper), l (lower), a digit 3-7 for other detectors or 'x' for
unknown.

For station dependent detectors, the tsys5 and tsys6 commands
are used to match the detectors to the corresponding caltemp5
and caltemp6.
