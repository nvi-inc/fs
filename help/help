HELP or ? - Display on-line help information

Syntax:     HELP=<command>
            or ?=<command>

Response:   <displays information on the screen>

      Comments: This command displays available information on the
specified SNAP command. Either the word HELP or the question mark
may be used. Typing HELP or ? alone gives a directory of available
help information.

This Field System command works the same as the HP system help
command. The help information is kept in files in the separate
directory /FS/HELP, one file per command.

The help information is displayed one screen at a time. If the file
is longer than about 20 lines, you are prompted at the bottom of
the screen to continue listing by hitting any key or to return to
the Field System by typing "A" to abort.

The <command> may be chosen from the following list:
