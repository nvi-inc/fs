                satellite - satellite tracking

            Syntax:     satellite=name,file,mode,wrap

            Response:   satellite/name,file,mode,wrap
                        satellite/tle0,name
                        satellite/tle1,tle_1
                        satellite/tle2,tle_2

Settable parameters:
        name    Satellite name or catalog number, up to 24 characters.
                All non-trailing blanks are significant. Default is the
                name defined by the TLE command if file is also null.
        file    File in /usr2/tle_files containing the TLE (Two Line
                Elements) for the satellite. Default is to use
                data defined by TLE commands.
        mode    tracking mode: track, radc, azel. Default: track.
        wrap    neutral, ccw (counter-clockwise), cw (clockwise), or
                null to indicate which wrap (or no specific one) the
                antenna should be on for this source. The local
                antenna may or may not respect this parameter.

Monitor-only parameters:
        tle_1  TLE line 1, maximum 69 characters
        tle_2  TLE line 2, maximum 69 characters


Comments:
If both the satellite name and file name are both null, the most
recently input TLEs from the TLE SNAP command are used. Both satellite
name and file must be null or both must have non-null values.

The antenna will begin moving to the new satellite position according to
the mode:

  radc:  satellite position converted radc and command as normal source
  azel:  satellite position commanded as fixed Az/El pointing
  track: track satellite position

The only mode guaranteed to work at all antennas is "radc". However,
in that mode unless the satellite appears to be stationary on the
celestial sphere, the antenna will drift off the satellite. For
antennas that implement fixed "azel" pointing (source name "azel"),
the "azel" mode should be useful for geostationary satellites and
other slow moving satellites. For stations that implement satellite
tracking in the their antenna interface ("antcn", mode 9), the "track"
mode can be used to follow an arbitrary track, if the antenna can keep
up.

This command generates 24 hours of ephemeris looking forward from the
current FS time.  The ephemeris is generated using a modified version
of the "predict" program, which is installed with the FS.

The wrap parameter is only relevent for Az/El antennas and may or may
not be implemented for any given antenna.

The commanded position reflects the effect of the most recent "satoff"
command, but only the first parameter of that command, seconds, is
guaranteed to work for "radc" and "azel" modes and only to about one
second accuracy.  What works in tracking mode depends on the local
implementation.  See the "satoff" command for additional information.

On command, the three(!) lines of the TLEs are logged for information
once the ephemeris is successfully generated. The monitor include the
TLEs as well.
