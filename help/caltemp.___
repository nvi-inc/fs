               caltemp - set noise cal temperatures

            Syntax:     caltemp=list

            Response:   caltemp/values

Settable parameters:

            list        List of total power integrators to report the
                        noise cal temperatures for.  Standard detector
                        mnemonics allowed.  In addition: for
                        VLBA/4/5/DBBC 'formif' and 'formbbc' are
                        permitted; for Mark III/IV/5, 'formif' and
                        'formvc' are permitted; station detectors 'u5'
                        and 'u6' are permitted.

Monitor-only parameters:

            values     List of detector & noise cal temperature pairs.
                       Temperatures are in degrees Kelvin.  A
                       temperature of -1.0 means no 'caltemp' value
                       could be found for this detector.  These values
                       are stored for use by the 'tsys' command.

Comments:

The results are returned grouped in pairs of 'mnemonic,value' for each
detector.  The output is collected into lines by IF channel.
Detectors that have no IF assigned are displayed first followed by
those for IFs '1'-'3' (Mark III/IV) or 'a'-'d' (VLBA/4/5/DBBC).  If
the output for an IF would make a long output line, the output is
split into more than one line.  For station detectors, the values are
displayed on one line.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the VCs are
displayed as 'hs', where 'h' is the VC number as hex and 's' is for
the sideband: 'd' (dual for upper/lower), 'u' (upper), 'l' (lower), a
digit '3'-'7' for other VC detectors or 'x' for unknown.

For VLBA/4/5/DBBC, additional mnemonics 'formif' and 'formbbc' are
permitted in the 'list'.  These select the detectors for the IF channels
and BBC sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter.  For Mark
III/IV/5, 'formvc' is accepted instead of 'formbbc', as well as
'formif'.

The noise cal value is determined from the channel IF, frequency, and
sideband using the information from the '.rxg' files.  For station
detectors, the 'user_device' command defines the parameters used with
the '.rxg' file data.
