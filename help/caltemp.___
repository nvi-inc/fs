               caltemp - set noise cal temperatures

            Syntax:     caltemp=list
          caltemp5=temp
          caltemp6=temp

            Response:   caltemp/values
          caltemp5/temp
          caltemp6/temp


Settable parameters:
            list        List of total power integrators to read back.
            Standard detector mnemonics allowed.
          temp      temperature of cal signal, in degrees K. These
          values are stored for use by the tsys5/6 commands.


Monitor-only parameters:
            values      List of values, degrees K. These values are stored
            for use by the tsys command.

Comments:
Except for station defined detectors, the results are returned
grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value, the output is
collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have no IF
assigned are displayed first followed by IFs 1-3 (Mark III/IV
or LBA4), 1-4 (LBA) and a-d (VLBA/4). If the output for an IF
would make a long output line, the output is split into more
than one line. For station defined detectors the results are
just displayed in order: u5, u6.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the
VCs are displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s
is for the detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u
(upper), l (lower), a digit 3-7 for other detectors or 'x' for
unknown.

The caltemp5/6 commands are used for defining the calibration
temperatures used with station dependent detectors u5 and u6.
