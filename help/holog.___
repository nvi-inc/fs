Comments:
This command uses the external program "holog" to perform a
Boustrophedon ("as the ox plows") scan centered on the current antenna
position with the specified Az and El spans ("azs" and "els").

For this program to work, the local antenna interface must implement
Az-El offsets, e.g., to support the "azeloff=..." command. 

The center point of the scan is determined from the currently
commanded "source=.." position including the application of currently
commanded AzEl offsets, i.e., "azeloff=...".  The effect of
"radc" and "xy" offsets is not included (so these should be zero
before starting this program), but could be easily added.  The current
position can be commanded as either a regular celestial source or an
"azel" position, but not fixed "hadc" ror "xy" pointing. However, the
missing ones could be easily added.

Within and up to the limits of the span, the antenna stops at a grid
of points, specified by the number of points for each axis ("azp" and
"elp") to execute a SNAP procedure with a name constructed from the
base name ("proc") with a "p" appended, referred to hereafter as the
measurement SNAP procedure.  For positive spans, the scan starts at
the most counterclockwise (viewed from above) azimuth and lowest
elevation grid point. The antenna traverses the azimuth positions
clockwise at the lowest elevation, then proceeds to the next elevation
and traverses the azimuths counterclockwise at that elevation. Then it
proceeds to the next elevation, where the azimuths are tranversed
clockwise again.  This pattern is repeated as necessary to visit all
the grid points, ending with the most clockwise azimuth and highest
elevation point.

The starting and ending points of the scan can be switched to
different corners of the grid by using a negative span for either or
both axes.  The long "furrows" of the scan are always along azimuth.

This command must be set-up, i.e., commanded with parameters
("holog=...") before the scan be run.  The scan is initated by
entering the command "holog".

If the "recal" value is not "off" (0) then before the scan is started,
the measurement SNAP procedure is executed at the center point.  This
is repeated after the scan ends.  In addition, if "recal" seconds have
passed since the last execution at the center point, the antenna is
moved there and the measurement SNAP procedure is re-executed.  This
is intended to provide periodic re-calibration points for antenna
holography.  The center point of the grid is omitted during the actual
scan.  If "recal" is "off" (0), the initial and final center point
scans are omitted and the center point of the grid is not omitted.

If the number of points for both axes are negative, a single cut is
done in each azimuth and elevation with the specified span and the
absolute value of number of points for the respective axes.

The azimuth span is adjusted by 1/cos(El) of the center point of the
scan to space the azimuth grid points in anglar rather than coordinate
units.

It is recommended that nothing else be done, e.g. running a 
schedule, while this command is executing. Since this command
may run for an extended period of time, a mechanism has been
supplied for aborting, enter:

   sy=brk holog &

as a SNAP command. After aborting, the antenna will be returned to
the center position.

The measurement SNAP procedure is run at each grid point.  Each time
the procedure is run, it is given an argument of the form:

   sa_se

where:
      a is the azimuth offset applied, printed in degrees with format %.3f
      e is the elevation offset applied, printed in degrees with format %.3f
      s is the sign of the offset
      _ is a separator character

This argument can be used in the procedure by specifying a dollar sign
"$" where it should be used.

The following is an example of a procedure, perhaps called "hologp"
("holog"+"p"), that might be useful for holography. It runs a script
on a remote computer and records s small amount of data with a Mark
5A/B recorder:

HOLOGP:   scan_name=$
          sy=ssh host scriptp $
          disk_pos
	  mk5=record=on:$;
          !+2s
          disk_record=off
          disk_pos
          sy=go holog & 

where "scriptp" is a shell script to run on the remote host.  Note
that since there is no ampersand "&" at the end of the "sy=ssh ..."
command the FS will wait for the ssh command to complete before
continuing.  Please note that if the actually used is script takes
less than one second to execute, a line:

          !+1s

should be inserted before the "sy=go holog &" line to avoid race
conditions in the coordination with the holog program.

The remote computer should be set to accept a connection from the FS
computer with prompting for a password, perhaps by sharing keys.

An initialization SNAP procedure is run after the antenna is onsource
for the first measurement on the center point. The name of procedure
is constructed from the base name ("proc") with an "i" appended,
referred to hereafter as the initialization SNAP procedure. The
initialization SNAP procedure is run with an argument that is the
date/time in the format: yyyy.ddd.hh:mm:ss (yyyy=year,ddd=day of year,
hh=hour, mm=minute, ss=second). This procedure can be used for any
initialization that should be done at the start of each holography
run. A sample script, "hologi" ("holog"+"i") is:

HOLOGI:   sy=ssh host scripti $
          !+1s
          sy=go holog & 

where "scripti" is shell script to run on remote host.  Note that
since there is no ampersand "&" at the end of the "sy=ssh ..." command
the FS will wait for the ssh command to complete before continuing. A
useful thing that this script might do is to set-up a link to a
directory that includes the date/time in its name to make sure that
data from each "holog" run goes into a unique directory, which is
documented incidently by the date/time. For example the remote script
might contain:

     mkdir $1
     ln -s $1 hologdata

assuming that "hologdata" is the directory name that "scriptp" uses to
store its data.

There is no requirement that this command be used for holography. It
can be used whenever it would be useful to execute a specific script
at different grid points around a central position.

The default wait time for of 120 seconds is generous, but can be
adjusted if necessary.  Slower antennas may need a longer time.
Shorter times are only useful to make holog give-up sooner if there is
a problem getting on-source.
