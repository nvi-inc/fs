		    rdbe - RDBE low level communication

            Syntax:     rdbe=<InString>,...
                        rdbe=<rdbe>,<InString>,...

            Response:   rdbe(<rdbe>)/<OutString>


Settable parameters:
        <rdbe>      letter: 'a','b', 'c', or 'd' for individual RDBE to address
        <InString>  string to be sent to RDBE(s). If the string does not end
                    with a semi-colon ";", one will be added. Multiple strings,
                    separated by commas, can be included in one command.

Monitor-only parameters:
        <OutString> resulting output from RDBE <rdbe> for one <InString> at a
                    time

Comments:
Like all RDBE commands, this command can either operate on all active
RDBEs or a particular one.  If the first parameter is specified as a
single letter in the range of possible RDBEs, the command is for that
RDBE only.  Responses always include the letter of the RDBE in
parenthesizes appended to the command name.  Active RDBEs are defined
by the "active_rdbes" command.  At start-up all configured RDBEs are
considered active.

Any supplied <rdbe> parameter that does not match a possible RDBE is
assumed to be an <InString> parameter for an all active devices
command.
