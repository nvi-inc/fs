PASS - Narrow track head positioning by pass number

Syntax:   PASS=<cmdPw>,<cmdPr>
          PASS
Response: PASS/<cmdPw>,<cmdPr>,<cmdMw>,<cmdMr>,
          <actMw>,<actMr>,<deltaMw>,<deltaMr>

Settable parameters:
<cmdPw>: command pass number for write head, range 1-100. Default is
         to not move the write head.
<cmdPr>: command pass number for read head, range 1-100. If the parameter
         is SAME, the read pass will be same as the write pass. Default is
         to not move the read head.

Monitor-only parameters:
<cmdMw>: microns corresponding to command write head pass number
<cmdMr>: microns corresponding to command read head pass number
<actMw>: microns corresponding to actual write head pass number
<actMr>: microns corresponding to actual read head pass number
<deltaMw>: micron error between actual and commanded write head position
<deltaMr>: micron error between actual and commanded read head position

Comments: This command moves the read and/or write heads to the position for
the commanded passes. The correspondence of pass numbers to micron positions is
established by the TAPEFORM command. The requested pass must have been set-up
by the TAPEFORM command to be used. Odd pass numbers are used for forward pass,
even for reverse.

An individual head can be moved by not specifying a command pass number for
the other head. The read command pass can be SAME, which causes it to be
the same as the write head pass number. This feature is useful for
setting both heads to the same pass number in set-up procedures.

The <delta> parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus commanded.

The commanded positions of the LVDT, PASS, and STACK commands are reported
consistently. For example, if you command the head positions with the STACK
or PASS command, you can determine the corresponding command voltage with
LVDT. And vice-versa, the micron position corresponding to a voltage
position commanded with LVDT can be determined with STACK or PASS.

The commanded pass numbers reported by PASS are given special values if
either LVDT or STACK last commanded the positions. If LVDT or STACK is used
with uncalibrated positions, the commanded pass number will be reported as
0. If the STACK command with forward calibrated positions was used, -1
will be reported for the pass number, for reverse calibrations -2 will be
reported.

When the write is moved by either PASS, STACK, or LVDT, the auxiliary
data field used by the Formatter is set to reflect the commanded position. 
The twelve characters of the auxiliary data field are set as: 

                       XXwxwxyzyzFF

where XX is: FF for forward calibration (odd passes)
             FE for reverse calibration (even passes)
             FD for uncalibrated positions.

       wxyz: 0000-3999 for positive micron positions
             4000-7999 for negative micron positions

         FF: hex characters FF

The positions occupied by wxyz are the four digits of the commanded micron
write head position. In the auxiliary data field the digits are repeated two
at a time.  The negative positions are represented as the 4000+ absolute
value of the position.  The XX field is used to identify which type of
calibration was used to set the position. The last two digits of the auxiliary
data are fixed with the value FF.
