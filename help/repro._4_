         repro - set up reproduce tracks (Mark IV drives)
 
              Syntax:      repro=mode,trackA,trackB,equalizer,bitrate
 
              Response:    repro/mode,trackA,trackB,equalizer,bitrate
 
 
 Settable parameters:
            mode       Reproduce mode, byp (default) for bypass, read or
            raw for playback.
            trackA     track for decoder channel A, between 0 and 35,
            default 2. For tracks on head stack 2, add 100 to
            the desired track number. If mode is read, only
            tracks from head stack 1 may be specified.
            trackB     track for decoder channel B, between 0 and 35,
            default 3. For tracks on head stack 2, add 100 to
            the desired track number. If mode is read, only
            tracks from head stack 1 may be specified. 
              equalizer    0, 1, 2 (default if mode is read), 3 or dis
              (default if mode is byp) to select the equalizer
              installed at location 0, 1, 2, or 3 in the
              recorder. Use 80, 135, 160, 270 to select the
              equalizer by playback rate according to the
              following table:
              Location 0    test/special
                           Location 1    135 or 80 ips (normally used for 4
              MHz playback)
                           Location 2    160/270 ips (normally used for 8
              MHz playback)
                           Location 3    disable reproduce (used for bypass
              mode)
              bitrate      Clock recovery bit rate, Mb/s. Choices are 16, 8,
              4, 2, or 1. Default is the bit rate that
              corresponds to the selected equalizer. For
              equalizer 80 or 135, default is 4; for equalizers
              160 and 270 default is 8. If equalizer is dis,
              this parameter is undefined but is set to have the
              legal value of 4.
 
 Monitor-only parameters: none
 
 Comments: 
 This command sets up the reproduce electronics in the tape
 drive. MAT module functions available for Mark IV.
 
 Tracks are Mark IV/VLBA track numbers.
 
 The read mode normally is used only when checking parity
 errors on the tape.
 
 Bypass mode looks at the output of the write drivers,
 therefore it only works if the selected track is enabled and
 the general record is on. Use the command st=for,0,on to set
 up the write drivers for bypass mode.
 
 Note that a VLBA or Mark IV track number equals the Mark III
 track number plus three. Consequently, odd Mark III tracks are
 even VLBA or Mark IV track numbers and vice-versa. See the
 Track Assignment Tables in the System Set-up manual. Also VLBA
 group numbers equal Mark III group numbers minus one, but the
 VLBA groups include additional tracks. Note that this command
 uses Mark IV track numbers.
