    label - enter tape VSN, check-label (longitudinal drives)

            Syntax:     label=vsn,check,type

            Response:   label/vsn,check,type


Settable parameters:
          vsn       8 or 10-character tape Volume Serial Number (VSN),
          e.g. HS001234.
        check   4-character check-label corresponding to VSN, e.g.
        8E45. If no check label appears on the tape, run
        program labck to generate it.
          type      thick or thin, defaults to type implied by VSN. For
          monitor, this value only appears until the tape is
          loaded with a rec=load command. This parameter is
          not available unless vacuum switching is enabled in
          sw.ctl control file.

Comments: 
Normally used after newtape command has halted the schedule.
There are two different modes of operation depending on
whether the Volume Serial Number (VSN) has 8 or 10 characters.
When the label command is entered directly by the operator,
8-character VSNs are used. Tape number and check label must
correspond or execution of the schedule will not continue. The
effect of this command is the same as that of cont. Digit
zeros "0" and letters "O" are both treated as zeros in both
number and check for operator convenience.

The ten-character mode will normally be used only by the rwand
program. In this mode, the first eight characters of vsn
correspond to the tape number, while the tenth character is
used for a checksum. Any other parameters are ignored. A fake,
but correct, check-label code will be generated if the
checksum is correct. Please note a trailing comma is necessary
if the tenth character (checksum) is a space.

For VLBA and VLBA4 drives and specially-equipped Mark IV
drives that use vacuum switching, this command is used to
specify whether the thick or thin vacuum level (and for VLBA
and VLBA4 drives the thickness parameters as well) are
commanded. Please see the rec command for more details.

Labels starting with the following strings (letters "O"
replaced by numerals "0")  are assumed to be thin by default:
0VLB, 3MTHN, CMVA, DSCP, EVNT, GIFT00, HST, ISAS, JIVE, MPIT,
NAIC, NASA, SAMP, SVLB, THNINT, UNQU, USN01, and VLBA. All
others are assumed to be thick. There are no known deviations
from this at this time. However, the type parameter can be used
to override the default if necessary.
