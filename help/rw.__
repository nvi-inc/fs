                         rw - rewind tape

Syntax:     rw

Response:   rw/acknowledgement


Settable Parameters: none

Comments: 
The tape is moved in reverse at high speed. For Mark III, the
record bit is disabled and the low tape sensor is turned on. For
VLBA, all track groups are disabled and the low tape sensor is
turned on.

For S2 drives, the selected transports are moved in reverse at the
transport's rewind speed.

For drives other that the S2, the tape is moved at the "schedule"
value as specified in the equip.ctl control file. This is the speed
assumed in the SNAP schedule file for positioning the tape with the
fastr procedure.

Use the srw command and sfastr procedure for possibly faster tape
motion.
