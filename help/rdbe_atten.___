		    rdbe_atten - RDBE attenuation

            Syntax:     rdbe_attenX=<if>,<atten>,<target>

            Response:   rdbe_attenX/<if>,<atten>,<target>,<ifx>,<attenx>,<RMSx>,<ify>,<atteny>,<RMSy>


Settable parameters:
        X          letter: 'a','b', 'c', 'd', or null for all active RDBEs
        <if>       IF to adjust: 0, 1, or "both". Default: both
        <atten>    attenuation value , 0-31.5 in 0.5 steps, or "auto"
                   when commanding to cause the RDBE(s) to automatically
                   adjust the level to get a raw sample RMS of <target>.
		   Default: auto.
        <target>   target RMS value: 0.0-128.0. Default is specified by the
                   rdbe.ctl control file. A non-default <target> cannot
                   be used with a numeric <atten>.

Monitor-only parameters:
        <ifx>      "0" or "1", the next two values are for that IF
        <attenx>   attenuation value for this IF.
        <RMSx>     RMS value for this IF.
        <ify>      "1", the next two values are for that IF, if present
        <atteny>   attenuation value for this IF, if present
        <RMSy>     RMS value for this IF, if present

Comments:
Like all commands that start with "rdbe", this command can either
operate on an individual RDBE if the letter for that RDBE is appended
to the command, or all active RDBEs if no letter is appended.  The
response always includes the letter of the RDBE the response came
from.  Active RDBEs are defined by the "active_rdbes" command.  At
start-up all configured RDBEs are considered active.

On command, the response does not show the commanded values and shows
the actual value for only the IFs adjusted.
