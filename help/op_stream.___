           op_stream - place command in operator stream

            Syntax:     op_stream=command

            Response:   none


Settable Parameters:
          command   The command to be placed in the operator command
          stream.

Comments:
This command can be used from the schedule to enter commands
into the operator stream. This is useful because a time-
scheduled command entered from the schedule stream will be
blocked when the schedule is executing a timed wait.

This command might be used to periodically record TIP values
during an observation. For example, the following procedures
might be used to sample TIP values every 10 seconds during an
observation:

            MIDOB:      op_stream=start
            ...

            START:      collect@!,10s

              COLLECT:      tpi=odd,even,if1,if2

            POSTOB:     collect@

A great deal of care needs to be exercised when using this
command. In particular, command should not cause any long
timed waits to occur since this will block the operator stream
(in a pinch, the operator stream can be freed from a long wait
by using the flush command). Also no command that might cause
interference with the execution of the schedule should be
used. In partiular this would mean avoiding the use of tape
motion commands.

Note that any use of @ in command is interpreted to apply to
the opstream=... command itself and is removed from the
command before what is left is placed in the operator stream.
This is the reason that the START procedure was necessary in
the example above.

This command is considered experimental. It creates a new type
of interaction between the schedule and operator streams. It
may be necessary to modify or remove this feature if some
unanticipated consequence proves to be a problem.
