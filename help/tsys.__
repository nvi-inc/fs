             tsys - compute and display system temps

Syntax:   tsys1=list
          tsys2=list
          tsys3=list
          tsysa=list
          tsysb=list
          tsysc=list
          tsysd=list

Response: tsys1/systemps
          tsys2/systemps
          tsys3/systemps
          tsysa/systemps
          tsysb/systemps
          tsysc/systemps
          tsysd/systemps


Settable parameters:
list        List of modules for which Tsys will be computed. Standard
            mnemonics allowed.

Monitor-only parameters:
systemps    List of system temperatures, computed from values
            retrieved by the tpi, tpical, and tpzero commands. -1.0
            means no current measurements available.

Comments: 
This command calculates and displays system temperatures for the
different IF channels. The command pairs, tsys1/a, tsys2/b, and
tsys3/c are synonymous. The calculations for the tsys1/2/3 and
tsysa/b/c/d commands use the noise calibration values specified in
the caltemp1/2/3 and caltempa/b/c/d commands, respectively. Either
USB or LSB system temperature is computed and displayed, depending
on the last-measured values for the total power. The formula is:

          tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/(tpical-tpi))

tsys          system temperature, as reported in tsys command
tpi           cal-off reading, from tpi command
tpzero        zero-level reading, from tpzero command
tpical        cal-on reading, from tpical command
caltemp       noise calibration source temperature, from caltemp
              command.
