tsys - system temps
Syntax:      tsys1=list
             tsys2=list
             tsysa=list
             tsysb=list

Response:    tsys1/systemps
             tsys2/systemps
             tsysa/systemps
             tsysb/systemps


Settable parameters:
list            list of modules for which Tsys will be computed.
                Standard mnemonics allowed.

Monitor-only parameters:
systemps        list of system temperatures, computed from
                values retrieved by the tpi, tpical, and
                tpzero commands. -1.0 means no current
                measurements available.

Comments: 
This command calculates and displays system temperatures for
channels 1 and 2 (Mark III) or channels A and B (VLBA).  The
command pairs, tsys1/tsysa and tsys2/tsysb, are
synonymous. The calculations for the tsys1/2 and tsysa/b
commands use the noise calibration values specified in the
caltemp1/2 and caltempa/b commands, respectively. 
Either USB or LSB system temperature is computed and displayed,
depending on the last-measured values for the total power. The
formula is:

       tsys = (tpi - tpzero) * (caltemp/(tpical-tpi))

tsys            system temperature, as reported in tsys
command
tpi             cal-off reading, from tpi command
tpzero          zero-level reading, from tpzero command
tpical          cal-on reading, from tpical command
caltemp         noise calibration source temperature, from
                caltemp command.
