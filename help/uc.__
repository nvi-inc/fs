Comments: 
MAT module functions are available.

Channel assignments for the "standard" receiver are on the next
page. Your station's channel assignments are in the rxdef.ctl
control file. Details of the MAT protocol are in the MAT
Communications manual.

UC must be specified in the matad.ctl control file.

This command is identical to the rx command except uc is for
uncooled receivers.
