TSYS1, TSYS2 - Compute and display system temps

Syntax:   TSYS1=<list>
          TSYS2=<list>
Response: TSYS1/<systemps>
          TSYS2/<systemps>

Settable parameters:
<list>: list of modules for which Tsys will be computed. Refer to
        description of <list> under TPI command.

Monitor-only parameters:
<systemps>: list of system temperatures, computed from values
            retrieved by the TPI, TPICAL, and TPZERO commands. -1.0
            means no current measurements available.

      Comments: Either USB or LSB system temperature is computed
and
displayed, depending on the last-measured values for the total
power. The calculations for TSYS1 and TSYS2 use the values of
CALTEMP1 and CALTEMP2 respectively. The formula is:

                 Tsys = (V-Vzero)*(Tcal/(Vcal-V)

where V=cal-off reading, Vzero=zero-level reading, Vcal=cal-on
reading, Tcal=noise cal temperature.
