CHECK - Modules to be checked by CHEKR

Syntax:   CHECK=<list>
Response: CHECK/<list>

Settable parameters:
<list>: list of modules to be checked. The list may include:
        Vn or VCn - individual video converter, n = 1,2,...,15 or
         1,2,...,F
        IF or IFD - IF distributor
        FM or FORM - formatter
        TP or TAPE - tape transport
        RX - receiver
        HD - high density tape heads
Other words recognized are:
        ALL - all modules
        ODD - odd video converters 1,3,5,7,9,11,13
        EVEN - even video converters 2,4,6,8,10,12,14
        <NULL> - do not check anything

Monitor-only parameters: none

     Comments: As modules are set up by SNAP commands, they are
automatically added to the list of modules being checked by CHEKR.
This command can be used to remove and reinstate modules on the
list.

The entire list of modules to be checked may always be specified
by listing the appropriate modules. However, the list of modules
already being checked may also be modified by entering * as the
first parameter, followed by the list of modules to be added or
deleted from the existing list. Deletion is indicated by a leading
(-) sign. For example,

                      CHECK = *,IFD,-TP

will cause the IF distributor to be added to the list of modules
being checked and the tape transport to be removed from the list,
while the CHECK status of all other modules remain unchanged.

If no modules are currently being checked then the list will be
displayed as: DISABLED.
