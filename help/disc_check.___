This command sets the read pointer 1 mega-byte before the
current write pointer location and attempts to the use the 
low-level Mark 5 data_check command. The displayed parameters
are the output of is command. A future version will allow the
position of the read pointer to be set explicitly, but this
can be done with a mk5 SNAP command. To check at positon
"pos", use:

mk5=play off pos,data_check?
