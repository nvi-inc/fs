           help or ? - display on-line help information

Syntax:     help=command
          ?=command

Response:   displays information on the screen


Settable Parameters:
command   The name of any SNAP command.

Comments:
This command displays available information on the specified SNAP
command. Either the command help or the question mark ? may be
used. Typing help or ? alone gives help on help. The help
information is essentially the listing of the manual page for the
SNAP command.

This Field System help command opens a new xterm window and uses
the less pager to display the requested help text one screen-full
at a time. At the bottom of the window you will see a prompt in
inverse video that includes the name of the file being displayed
(which you can ignore). If you want to continue the listing, press
the space bar and the next screen-full will be displayed. To exit
from the command, type the letter q (not echoed on the screen). For
help with less, type the letter h to the prompt. The full options
of less are available including text searches and scrolling back.

In some cases statistics about where in the file the current
screen-full comes from may be displayed in the prompt. In some
cases, less will display only a colon : prompt.

When you see (END) in inverse video in the prompt at the bottom of
the screen, you have reached the end of the help information on
this topic. Press the letter q to exit. When you press q, the help
xterm window will close automatically. While the text is displayed
in the window you can also use the xterm scroll bar to move around
within the text.

The help information is kept in files in the directory
/usr2/fs/help, one file per command. Versions for different
configurations are distinguished by the two characters in the file
extension for the type of hardware. The first character is for the
type of rack and the second is for the type of recorder. The
characters used are m for Mark III, v for VLBA, 4 for Mark IV, and
_ for any. The content of the files is the ASCII version of the
pages in this manual. Station-dependent help files are found in
/usr2/st/help.

If no help is available for a command, a message to that effect
will be displayed in the log output window. You will also receive
this message if you request help for a command that is not defined
for your equipment.
