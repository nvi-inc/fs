help or ? - display on-line help
Syntax:      help=command
             ?=command

Response:    displays information on the screen


Settable Parameters:
command      The name of any SNAP command.

Comments:
This command displays available information on the specified
SNAP command. Either the word help or the question mark may
be used. Typing help or ? alone gives a directory of available
help information.

This Field System command works the same as the UNIX system
man command which uses the UNIX more command. The help
information is displayed one screen at a time. If the information is
longer than about 20 lines, you see --More-- at the bottom of
the screen. To continue listing, press the space bar. To exit from
the command, type the letter q (not echoed on the screen).

When you see --No more-- at the bottom of the screen, you
have reached the end of the help information. If you press the
space bar one more time the window will be closed. While the text
is displayed in the window you can use the scroll bar to move
around within the text.

The help information is displayed in a temporary window that is
opened in the center of the screen. When you type q, or if you
press the space bar when --No more-- is displayed, the window
will be closed.

The help information is kept in files in the directory /usr2/fs/help,
one file per command. The content of the files is the ASCII
version of the pages in this manual.
