nn is the BBC index number corresponding to its position in the
rack, 01 to 16. Not all racks have all BBCs.

Settable Parameters:
freq               L.O. frequency in MHz, between 500.00
                   and 999.99. No default.
ifsource           I.F. input source, one of A, B, C, D. No
                   default.
bwu                Bandwidth for USB in MHz. One of
                   0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
                   4, 8, 16. Default 2.
bwl                Bandwidth for LSB in MHz. One of
                   0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2,
                   4, 8, 16. Default bwu.
avper              Averaging period in seconds for TPI. May be
                   0, 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 40, or 60
                   seconds. A value of 0 results in 1/80 sec
                   averaging time. Default 1. The averaging
                   period is common to both upper and lower
                   sideband. The averaging period is
                   synchronous with the 1 pps.
gainmode           Gain control mode, one of agc, man. Use
                   agc (default) for automatic gain control, man
                   to set a gain value. The gain mode is common
                   to both sidebands.
gainu              Gain value for USB. This is a valid parameter
                   only if gainmode is man. May be any value
                   between -99.0 dB and 12.0 dB. Step size
                   is linear in voltage. If gainmode is agc, the
                   actual gain setting is reported as a monitor
                   value. Default is the current USB gain level.
                   This parameter is not implemented.
gainl              Gain value for LSB. This is a valid parameter
                   only if gainmode is man. May be any value
                   between -99.9 dB and 12.0 dB. Step size
                   is linear in voltage. If gainmode is agc, the
                   actual gain setting is reported as a monitor
                   value. Default is the current LSB gain level.
                   This parameter is not implemented.

Monitor-only Parameters:
lock               L.O. lock status, lock or unlock.
USBpwr             Power in upper sideband in counts. Range 0
                   to 65535, nominal operating level is 16000.
LSBpwr             Power in lower sideband in counts. Range 0
                   to 65535, nominal operating level is 16000.
serno              Module serial number, decimal.
err                Module timing error indication, 1pps or
                   no_1pps.

Comments:
This command sets up the baseband converters in the VLBA rack.
This command is analagous to the Mark III vcnn commands.

MCB module functions are available. See section 1.0 of this
manual.

The power-up setting for the gain control is manual control with
a value of +6 dB. If the IF level is nominal coming in to the BBC
then the operating level for the AGC is +6 dB. Normal setting
during an experiment is agc.

To hold the gain at a given value, switch to man gain control. The
gain value will stay at the value it had while the AGC was on.
Then use agc to return to AGC control. This method is used for
radiometry by onoff and fivpt.

On terminals wired like the Interferometrics racks, the following
table shows which BBCs have which IF inputs available.
