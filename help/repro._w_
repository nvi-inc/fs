              Syntax:      repro=modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB,bitrate
 
              Response:    repro/modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB,bitrate
 
 
 Settable parameters:
              modeA        Reproduce mode for channel A. byp (default) for
              bypass, raw or read for read (playback).
            trackA     Track for decoder channel A, default 4. 0-35
            allowed for VLBA, in addition 100-135 are allowed
            for VLBA4.
            trackB     Track for decoder channel B, default 4. 0-35
            allowed for VLBA, in addition 100-135 are allowed
            for VLBA4.
              modeB        Reproduce mode for channel B. byp for bypass, raw
              or read for read (playback). Default is modeA.
            equA       Equalizer to use for decoding channel A: std,
            alt1, alt2, dis (disable) or reproduce speed 80,
            135, 160, 270 ips or 0, 1, 2, or 3 equalizer
            number.  For VLBA recorders: alt1 (default) for
            normal speed (135 or 80 ips), alt2 for double
            speed (270 ips), and std for thin tape double
            speed (160 ips). For VLBA2 recorders: std
            (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt1 for
            double speed (270 ips), alt2 unspecified.  For
            VLBA2 recorders, thin tape speeds 80 and 160 ips
            are not accepted.
            equB       Equalizer to use for decoding channel B: std,
            alt1, alt2, dis (disable) or reproduce speed 80,
            135, 160, or 270 ips or 0, 1, 2, or 3 equalizer
            number. For VLBA recorders: alt1 (default) for
            normal speed (135 or 80 ips), alt2 for double
            speed (270 ips), and std for thin tape double
            speed (160 ips). For VLBA2 recorders: std
            (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt1 for
            double speed (270 ips), alt2 unspecified.  For
            VLBA2 recorders, thin tape speeds 80 and 160 ips
            are not accepted.
              bitrate      Nominal bit rate per track in Mbits/second: 16, 8,
              4, 2, 1, or 0.5. The default corresponds to the
              nominal bitrate for the equA setting.
 
 Monitor-only parameters: none
 
 Comments: 
 The raw or read mode normally is used only when checking
 parity errors on the tape. This is also known as "playback"
 mode.
 
 This bitrate parameter determines the set-up of the clock
 recovery chip. The nominal bit rate for the 135/80 ips (VLBA)
 or 135 ips (VLBA2) equalizer is 4 Mb/sec (2 MHz track
 bandwidth) set-up. The nominal bit rate for the 270 and 160 
 ips equalizers is 8 Mb/sec (4 MHz track bandwidth) set-up. The
 other bit rates have no corresponding equalizer and are useful
 only in byp mode. The other bit rates have not been tested
 with the VLBA2 drive.
 
 Note that a VLBA or Mark IV track number equals the Mark III
 track number plus three. Consequently, odd Mark III tracks are
 even VLBA or Mark IV track numbers and vice-versa. See the
 Track Assignment Tables in the System Set-up manual. Also VLBA
 group numbers equal Mark III group numbers minus one, but the
 VLBA groups include additional tracks. Note that this command
 uses VLBA track numbers.
