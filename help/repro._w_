       repro - set up reproduce tracks (VLBA, VLBA4 drives)

            Syntax:     repro=modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB,bitrate

            Response:   repro/modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB,bitrate


Settable parameters:
            modeA       Reproduce mode for channel A. byp (default) for
            bypass, raw or read for read (playback).
              trackA        Track for decoder channel A, default 4. 0-35
              allowed for VLBA, in addition 100-135 are allowed
              for VLBA4.
              trackB        Track for decoder channel B, default 4. 0-35
              allowed for VLBA, in addition 100-135 are allowed
              for VLBA4.
            modeB       Reproduce mode for channel B. byp for bypass,
            raw or read for read (playback). Default is
            modeA.
            equA        0 (default for VLBA2 drives if modeA is read), 1
            (default for non-VLBA2 drives if modeA is read),
            2, 3 to select the equalizer installed at location
            0, 1, 2, or 3 in the recorder. In addition dis
            selects location 3. For VLBA drives use 80, 135,
            160, 270 to select the equalizer by playback rate
            according to the following table:
              Location 0    160 ips
              Location 1    135 or 80 ips (normally used for 4
MHz playback)
              Location 2    270 ips (normally used for 8 MHz
playback)
              Location 3    disable reproduce (used for bypass
mode)
                        For VLBA2 drives use 135 for location 0 and 270
            for location 1. For backward compatibility, you
            can also select locations 0, 1, and 2 as std,
            alt1, and alt2 respectively.
            equB        Same as equA, but defaults to equA
              bitrate       Nominal bit rate per track in Mbits/second: 16, 8,
              4, 2, 1, or 0.5. The default corresponds to the
              nominal bitrate for the equA setting.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The raw or read mode normally is used only when checking
parity errors on the tape. This is also known as "playback"
mode.

This bitrate parameter determines the set-up of the clock
recovery chip. The nominal bit rate for the 135/80 ips (VLBA)
or 135 ips (VLBA2) equalizer is 4 Mb/sec (2 MHz track
bandwidth) set-up. The nominal bit rate for the 270 and 160 
ips equalizers is 8 Mb/sec (4 MHz track bandwidth) set-up. The
other bit rates have no corresponding equalizer and are useful
only in byp mode. The other bit rates have not been tested
with the VLBA2 drive.

Note that a VLBA or Mark IV track number equals the Mark III
track number plus three. Consequently, odd Mark III tracks are
even VLBA or Mark IV track numbers and vice-versa. See the
Track Assignment Tables in the System Set-up manual. Also VLBA
group numbers equal Mark III group numbers minus one, but the
VLBA groups include additional tracks. Note that this command
uses VLBA track numbers.
