Comments:

These commands are used for low-level communication with a DBBC2 or
DBBC3.

The commands for a DBBC2 are dbbc and dbbc2. The first, dbbc, is used
for communication with the first, or only, DBBC2 in a system, which is
defined in the dbbad.ctl control file.  This is the DBBC2 used for
normal DBBC2 operations.

The second command, dbbc2, is for use in systems with a "second" DBBC2
and communicates with the second one, defined in the dbba2.ctl control
file. The (limited) FS support for a second DBBC2 is provided to
enable two DBBC2 VGOS operations.

The command for a DBBC3 is dbbc3. The DBBC3 is defined in the
dbbad.ctl control file.

For multi-line responses from DBBC2s and DBBC3s, the dbbcn (and dbbc2
for a "second" DBBC2) program logs all lines except the last. The
dbbcn logged lines use #dbbcn# (#dbbc2# for a second DBBC2) in the log
entires. The last line is logged as a normal response.

The dbbc command cannot be used if the rack type in equip.ctl
specifies a DBBC3. The dbbc3 command cannot be used if the rack type
in equip.ctl specifies a DBBC2. Other rack types do not limit the use
of these commands.
