Comments:

These commands are used for low-level communication with a DBBC2 or
DBBC3.

The commands for a DBBC2 are dbbc and dbbc2. The first, dbbc, is used
for communication with the first, or only, DBBC2 in a system, which is
defined in the dbbad.ctl control file.  This is the DBBC2 used for
normal DBBC2 operations.

The second command, dbbc2, is for use in systems with two DBBC2s and
communicates with the second one, defined in the dbba2.ctl control
file. The (limited) FS support for a second DBBC2 is provided to
enable two DBBC2 VGOS operations.

The command for a DBBC3 is dbbc3. The dbbc3 is defined in the
dbbad.ctl control file.

For multi-line responses from DBBC2s and DBBC3s, the dbbcn program
logs all lines except the last. The dbbcn logged lines use #dbbcn# in
the log entires. The last line is logged as a normal response.
