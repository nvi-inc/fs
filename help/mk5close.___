              mk5close - Close the Mark V connection

            Syntax:     mk5close

            Response:   none


Comments:
This command can be used to close the connection to a Mark V5
recorder. It is recommended that this be done prior to
shutting down the Mark V control program for a disc swap. The
connection can be re-opened with the mk5relink command.
