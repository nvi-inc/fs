              mk5close - Close the Mark 5 connection

            Syntax:     mk5close

            Response:   none


Comments:
This command can be used to close the connection to a Mark 5
recorder. It is recommended that this be done prior to
shutting down the Mark 5 control program for a disk swap. The
connection can be re-opened with the mk5relink command.
