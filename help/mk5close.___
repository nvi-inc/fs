Comments:
This command can be used to close the connection to the Mark 5 or
FlexBuff recorder. It is recommended that this be done prior to
shutting down the Mark 5 control program for a disk swap. The
connection can be re-opened with the 'mk5relink' command.

The 'fb_close' command is a synonym for 'mk5close'. Whichever makes
the most sense can be used.
