   savev - save voltage position of stack (longitudinal drives)

            Syntax:     savev=parm1,volts
          savev

            Response:   savev/VrevW,V15rev,V15for,V15scale,V13,V15flip,Vw0,Vw8


Settable parameters:
          parm1     Voltage to save, possible values are: vrevw, v15rev,
          v15for, v15scale, v13, v15flip, vw0, or vw8. No
          default. clear will delete all saved voltages.
            volts       The voltage value to save. Default is to use the
            current write position for vw0 and vw8, if the
            write head has been successfully positioned. For
            all others, use the last peaked voltage location
            from the peak command. If the write head has not
            been positioned or the last peak failed, no value
            is stored.

Monitor-only parameters:
The first six monitor parameters are read head position
voltages for peak response while reproducing tracks in various
configurations. The table below summaries the parameters and
the configuration: the track used to reproduce, the reproduce
tape orientation, read direction, the direction the track was
written in, and the write head position when the track was
written. All tracks are written with head 15 with the tape in
the normal orientation. (All track numbers are Mark III track
numbers.)

                  V15flip   15  Flipped     Forward Forward Vw0

The last two parameters are write head position voltages at
which the tracks corresponding to the above read positions
were written. These parameters are not used for VLBA drives.

          Vw0       Voltage near tape center
          Vw8       Voltage approximately 8 volts toward the deck
          plate from Vw0.

Comments: 
This command is used to save the voltage positions of the read
and write heads for head calibration.  This command is not
very useful by itself. It is designed to facilitate
calculation of the calibration parameters by  storing all the
values. The hdcalc command is used to perform the actual
calculation. See the Narrow Track Calibration manual for more
information.

The description of the monitor only parameters above is
written assuming odd tracks will be used for both read and
write. If odd tracks are not available, the corresponding even
tracks, 16 for write, 14 and 16 for read can be used instead
(note Mark III track numbers).

The response form of the command will only show values for
voltages that have been successfully saved. This feature is
useful for determining which parameters have not been
successfully measured during automated calibration.
