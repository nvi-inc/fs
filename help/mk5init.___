              mk5init - Reinitialize the Mark 5 connection

            Syntax:     mk5init

            Response:   none


Comments: This command can be used to reinitialize the connection to a
Mark 5 recorder. The existing connection, if any exists, is closed.
The mk5ad.ctl control file is reread and a new connection open. This
provides a method to change which Mark 5 is being used, as set in the
mk5ad.ctl control file,  without restarting the FS.
