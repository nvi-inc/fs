        mk5init - Reinitialize the Mark 5/FlexBuff connection

            Response:   none


Comments:
This command can be used to reinitialize the connection to the Mark 5
or FlexBuff recorder. The existing connection, if any exists, is
closed. The 'mk5ad.ctl' control file is reread and a new connection
open. This provides a method to change which Mark 5 or FlexBuff is
being used, as set in the 'mk5ad.ctl' control file, without restarting
the FS.

The 'fb_init' command is a synonym for 'mk5init'. Whichever makes
the most sense can be used.
