               wx - get current weather parameters

Syntax:     wx

Response:   wx/temp,press,humid


Settable parameters: none

Monitor-only parameters:
temp          current temperature, degrees C.
press         current barometric pressure, mbars.
humid         current humidity, %.

Comments: 
In the standard version of this command, used when the standard
met sensor package is available, temperature, barometric pressure
and relative humidity are automatically read from the met sensor,
displayed at the operator's terminal and written to the Field
System log. 

If a nonstandard met package is used, a special station-specific
version of this command may be available. 

If no electronic met sensor is available, a manual version of the
command may be implemented. It may prompt for the required
information as follows:

Enter current outdoor temperature (C):
Enter current barometric pressure (mbars):
Enter current humidity (%):

When the manual version of the command is used, the value for
pressure is checked to make sure it's greater than zero, and
humidity is checked to make sure it is between 0 and 100. A
wakeup command should be issued before manual wx when included in
a procedure in order to gain the operator's attention.
