               wx - get current weather parameters

            Syntax:     wx

            Response:   wx/temp,press,humid,speed,direction


Settable parameters: none

Monitor-only parameters:
              temp          current temperature, degrees C.
              press         current barometric pressure, mbars.
              humid         current humidity, %.
              speed         current wind speed, meters/second
                direction       current wind direction, degrees of azimuth

Comments: 
The standard version of this command is designed to report met
parameters from either a CDP or MET3  met sensor. Wind
information is only reported for MET3 packages and when a
Vaisala Ultrasonic Wind Sensor is available.

This command may be implemented locally to support non-
standard packages, but should still return met parameters in
the order shown. Wind speed and direction may not be available
for some Met. sensors.

If no electronic met sensor is available, a manual version of
the command may be implemented. It may prompt for the required
information as follows:

Enter current outdoor temperature (C):
Enter current barometric pressure (mbars):
Enter current humidity (%):

When the manual version of the command is used, the value for
pressure is checked to make sure it's greater than zero, and
humidity is checked to make sure it is between 0 and 100. A
wakeup command should be issued before manual wx when included
in a procedure in order to gain the operator's attention.
