RESET - Reset the MAT bus

Syntax:   RESET=<baud>
Response: RESET/<baud>

Settable parameters:
<baud>: baud rate. MATs support 110, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800,
        and 9600 baud. 

Monitor-only parameters: none

      Comments: The old ATs (NRAO only) support 2400 baud only.
Recommended rate is 9600. A system reset is sent (break), then an
EXEC 3 to change the baud rate, then some U's to synch up the MATs.
Not all BAUD rates may be available depending on which MUX port the
MAT bus is on and what other ports and BAUD rates are in use.

Refer to the Computer Reference manual for a discussion of baud
rate selection.
