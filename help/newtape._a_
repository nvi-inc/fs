    newtape - halt schedule until tape is mounted (all drives)

Syntax:     newtape=tape

Response:   newtape/"To continue, use LABEL  command"
          newtape/LABEL=label


Settable Parameters:
tape        Used for a K4 drive with DMS only: Tape number for
            the DMS to load, 1-24. Default is to not use the DMS.

Monitor-only Parameters:
label       Used for a K4 drive with DMS only: the label read
            when the tape was loaded

Comments:
If  a tape number is specified, the DMS is instructed to insert
the tape specified from the DMS into the recorder. The DMS is
instructed to read the label bar-code on the tape. The response
shows the label read. The "To continue response does not appear.
If a schedule is halted, its execution continyes

If no tape number is specified (i.e., if newtape= , or newtape is
entered) for a non-K4 drive or for a K4 drive without a DMS
installed, the response will be displayed and the schedule will
be halted until a label is entered. The LABEL= response does not
appear.

For non-K4 drives or for a K4 with no DMS, this command in effect
is the same as the halt command. Execution will continue after
the label command has been successfully completed. If you are in
a rush, the cont command will also work to continue execution of
the schedule
