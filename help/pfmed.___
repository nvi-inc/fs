"pfmed" is not a FS SNAP command.  It is a utility for managing and
editing SNAP procedure file.  This help page has some tips on using
it.

"pfmed" has a "help" command that will display the available commands
and a terse description of each.  Generally the commands that start
with "pf" operate on the procedure files and the ones that operate on
the procedures within a file (plus some utility ones) don't.  The most
unusual thing about "pfmed", and it takes some getting use to, is that
commas are used to separate parts of commands instead of spaces.  The
terms 'procedure file', 'procedure library', and 'procedure file
library' are used interchangeably.

When "pfmed" starts-up, it lists:

 (1) the name of the active 'schedule' procedure file,
 (2) the name of active 'station' procedure file, and
 (3) the name of the procedure file currently open in "pfmed".

The adjective "active" for (1) and (2) indicates that listed files are
currently in use in the FS, unless they are "none".  The 'schedule'
procedure file is the procedure file opened in the FS by the
"schedule=" or the "proc=" commands.  In the case of "schedule=", this
is the procedure file with the same name (up to the dot ".")  as the
schedule file.  The 'station' procedure file is always "station"
unless the FS is not running, in which case it is "none".  The file
currently open in "pfmed" is the one that the commands that operate on
procedures work with.  You can change which file is active with the
"pf" command.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Always edit procedure files using "pfmed".  This is
a little more cumbersome than editing it directly with your favorite
editor, but procedures files have an internal structure and "pfmed"
maintains that.  If structure is damaged the file will not work
correctly with the FS.

While it is possible to 'get away' with not using "pfmed" when the FS
is not running, it is absolutely necessary to use it when the FS is
running.  Otherwise the procedure file is likely to be corrupted when
the FS accesses it and the FS may crash or misbehave.  Always using
"pfmed" is strongly recommended as a small discipline that will help
prevent accidently forgetting to use it when the FS is running.
Please follow this advice; it will make life easier for everyone.

The "vi" and "emacs" editors are integrated into "pfmed" and you can
specify any other editor you want to use by setting the EDITOR
environment variable in your account (usually "oper").  Please see the
"ed" command in the "pfmed" "help" command output.

A description of how the schedule and station procedure files interact
is included in the comments section of the help page for the
"schedule" command.
