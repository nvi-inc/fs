             disk_pos - Mark 5 byte position pointers

            Syntax:     disk_pos

            Response:
            MK5A:       disk_pos/write_pointer, read_pointer

            MK5B:       disk_pos/write_pointer, start-scan, stop-scan


Monitor-only parameters:
                write_pointer   Current write pointer byte position
                read_pointer    Current read pointer byte position
                start-scan      Current start-scan pointer byte position
                stop-scan       Current stop-scan pointer byte position

Comments:
For Mark 5A, this command reports the current write and read pointers;
for Mark 5B, the current write, start-scan, and stop-scan
pointers. The start-scan and stop-scan pointers define the data range
for certain data check and transfer operatons. The start-scan pointer
is roughly analogous to a read pointer.

See the Mark 5A amd Mark 5B command sets for more details. For Mark
5A, this command returns the result of the "position?" query, for Mark
5B, the "pointers?" query.
