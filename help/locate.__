locate - locate head position
Syntax:      locate=range,nsamples,step,head
             locate

Response:    locate/range,nsamples,step,head,pea
             kv,mper,vltlc


Settable parameters:
range           +/- range to search over in microns. Default is
                200.
nsamples        Number of power samples for each measurement
                position. Default is 1.
step            Micron step size between measurement positions.
                Default is 40.
head            Head to move: read or write. Only the first
                character is checked. Only write is valid for
                VLBA.

Monitor-only parameters:
peakv           peak measured voltage from power detector
mper            minimum sample voltage as a percentage of
                peakv
vltlc           location of the peak in positioner voltage

Comments: 
This command performs a coarse grid search for the largest
detected power over the search range.  The search is performed
over a range of ñrange microns about the initial head position.
The number of positions sampled is ((2*range)/step)+1.

The actual positions at which measurements are made are not
exactly step microns part. The head will be positioned within
+/- 5 microns of the nominal positions. This approximation is
used to reduce the time moving the heads by not over-refining the
positions of what is a coarse search anyway. In the worst (too
coarse) case two positions might be step+10 microns apart.

After sampling over the complete range, locate returns the head
to the position that gave the highest power level, makes a new
measurement and reports these values for the peakv, mper, and
vltlc parameters.

This command requires that the reproduce power detector be
hooked-up with a reasonable amount of attenuation and that the
head.ctl control file correctly identify which detector (odd or even)
is in use.

This command must be issued once with parameters to set it up.
Issuing the command subsequently without parameters will start a
search. The tape must moving and there must be recorded data to
reproduce for this command to do something useful.

See the Narrow Track Calibration manual.
