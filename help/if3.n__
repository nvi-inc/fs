         if3 - IF3 distributor (Mark III, Mark IV racks)


Syntax:     if3=atten,mixer,sw1,sw2,sw3,sw4,pcal

Response:   if3/atten,mixer,sw1,sw2,sw3,sw4,pcl,switch,cntrl,freq
            ,rem/lcl,LOlock,TPI


Settable parameters:
atten     Attenuation in dB, range 0-63, default 0. Enter an
          integer value preceded by + or - to indicate a relative
          change. Other options are: max, or old to restore the
          previous value after max.
mixer     Downconverter in or out of the signal path, default
          out. In response only: 11 or 00.
sw1       Switch 1 state: output to port 1 (default) or port 2.
sw2       Switch 1 state: output to port 1 (default) or port 2.
sw3       Switch 1 state: output to port 1 (default) or port 2.
sw4       Switch 1 state: output to port 1 (default) or port 2.
pcl       Phase-cal control setting on (default) or off.

Monitor-only parameters:
switch    external switch, present or missing.
cntrl     phase-cal control modification, present or missing.
freq      Synthesizer frequency in MHz.
rem/lcl   Switch setting, rem or lcl
LOlock    LO lock/unlock status, lock or unlock
TPI       Total power integrator reading, decimal, 0-65535.

Comments:
MAT module functions are available. See section 1.0 of this
manual.

The max and old values for atten can be used to switch in the
maximum attenuation and then restore the previous (old)
attenuation. This is primarily useful for system temperature
measurements. See the sxcts procedure in the Standard Procedure
manual for an example.

The mixer state commanded by this command and the down converter
frequency specified in the equip.ctl control file are used by the
pcal command to calculate the frequencies of the phase-cal tones
for the video converters that are specified as connected to IF3
with the patch command. The beam3 command also uses this
information to calculate the default beam size.

If the switch for the mixer is an undefined state, the mixer
response is 11 or 00 depending on which incorrect state the mixer
is in, see the MAT Protocol manual for details.

The monitor values of the switch settings sw1-sw4 are null
(empty) if the equip.ctl file shows the switch as not connected.
Only switches that have been identified as connected can be
commanded. The switch monitor-only parameter indicates whether
the switch box itself is installed.

The external switch settings sw1-sw4 commanded are not used to
calculate the patching. The effect of the switch settings, i.e.,
which video converters are connected to which inputs, must be
specified in the appropriate patch command.

Unless low-pass filters have been installed in some of the output
channels, the IF3 module should only be used to distribute "high"
170-500 MHz IF frequencies to the video converters.

The cntrl parameter is only displayed if if3 is set as the phase-
cal control type in equip.ctl.

Some racks may not have the IF3 module installed.
