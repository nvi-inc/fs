           cablediff - calculate cable change and sign

            Syntax:     cablediff

            Response:   cablediff/change,sign


Settable parameters: None

Monitor-only parameters:
              change        The absolute value of the difference between the
              last cable and cablelong measurements, in
              seconds. The value is printed in scaled
              scientific notation so that the digit before the
              decimal point is microseconds. If the value is
              greater than 1.0 seconds the scaling is
              different.
              sign          The sign of the difference between the last
              cable and cablelong measurements absolute value
              of the difference between the last cable and
              cablelong measurements, corresponding to change.
              Values are +, -, or the value 0 if change is
              less than 0.05 microseconds.

Comments: 
This command is used to automatically calculate the change in
the cable counter reading when a short cable extension is
added to check the performance of the system and sign of the
change. This command provides a standard format for recording
the results in the log.
