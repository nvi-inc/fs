          dbbcrelink - re-establish the DBBC connection

            Syntax:     dbbcrelink

            Response:   none


Comments:
This command can be used to open a new connection to the DBBC. If the
connection is already open, it will be closed and new one
established. Opening a new connection is needed after the DBBC's
control program has been restarted or its power has been cycled.
