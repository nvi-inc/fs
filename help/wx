WX - Get current weather parameters

Syntax:   WX
Response: WX/<temp>,<press>,<humid>

Settable parameters: none

Monitor-only parameters:
<temp>: current temperature, degrees C.
<press>: current barometric pressure, mbars.
<humid>: current humidity, %.

     Comments: In the standard version of this command, used when
the standard met sensor package is available, temperature,
barometric pressure and relative humidity are automatically read
from the met sensor, displayed at the operator's terminal and
written to the Field System log. If a nonstandard met package is
used, the command works the same way, but special station-specific
software is required to implement the command. If no electronic met
sensor is available, there is a manual version of the command which
prompts for the required information as follows:

     Enter current outdoor temperature (C):
     Enter current barometric pressure (mbar):
     Enter current humidity (%):

     When the manual version of the command is used, the value for
pressure is checked to make sure it's greater than zero, and
humidity is checked to make sure it is between 0 and 100. A WAKEUP
command should be issued before manual WX when included in a
procedure in order to gain the operator's attention.
