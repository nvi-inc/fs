Comments:
This command allows a user to store a string in a file. The
contents of the first line or all lines of file can be executed
as commands by omitting the string parameter. This might be used
for example to store the name of a set-up SNAP procedure for a
receiver in a file. The set-up procedure can then be invoked
by the initi procedure when the FS is started. This will
effectively make the receiver set-up commanded in the initi
procedure variable without having to modify initi itself for
each receiver change.

If file does not start with +, then for reading only the first
line of the file will be read and executed. For writing, if
the file already exists its contents will unceremoniously
overwritten unless there is a permission conflict that
prevents it.

If file starts with +, it is removed from the file name and
interpreted as a flag meaning "append" for writing or "read
all lines" for reading.  This can be used to append additional
commands to an existing file (although it will create the file
if it doesn't exist). It will cause all lines in a file to be
executed as commands when reading from the file.
