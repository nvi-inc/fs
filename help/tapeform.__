                  tapeform - specify tape format

Syntax:     tapeform=pass,offset,pass,offset, ...

Response:   tapeform/pass,offset,pass,offset, ...


Settable parameters:
pass    The pass number whose offset follows, must be between 1 and
        100 for Mark III and VLBA, between 1 and 112 for Mark IV. 
offset  The a priori offset, in microns, for the preceding pass,
        must be between 1 and +/-4000.

Comments: 
The passes and offsets must appear in pairs. Multiple commands are
allowed because all of the pairs will not fit on a single line. The
offsets are are used by the pass command to position the head
stack(s) by pass number.

These commands appear in standard procedures named tapeforma,
tapeformb, tapeformc, tapeformd, one for each recording mode. The
appropriate procedure is invoked in the setup procedure. For
example, sx2c1 and sx2c2 invoke tapeformc.

For Mark IV modes, passes for stack 1 should be between 1 and 12.
For stack 2 passes, add 100 to the pass number for stack 1.
