tapeform - specify tape format
Syntax:      tapeform=pass,offset,pass,offset,
             ...

Response:    tapeform/pass,offset,pass,offset,
             ...


Settable parameters:
pass            the pass number whose offset follows, must be
                between 1 and 28*12. 
offset          the a priori offset, in microns, for the preceding
                pass, must be between 1 and +/-4000.

Comments: 
The passes and offsets must appear in pairs. Multiple commands
are allowed because all of the pairs will not fit on a single line.
These commands appear in standard procedures named
tapeforma, tapeformb, tapeformc, tapeformd, one
for each recording mode. The appropriate procedure is invoked in
the setup procedure. For example, sx2c1 and sx2c2 invoke
tapeformc.
