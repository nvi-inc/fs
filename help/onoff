ONOFF - On-off radiometry

Syntax:   ONOFF=<rep>,<intp>,<dev1>,<dev2>,<cutoff>, <stp>
Response: ONOFF/<rep>,<intp>,<dev1>,<dev2>,<cutoff>,<stp>,
          <cal1>,<cal2>,<beam1>,<beam2>,<flux1>, <flux2>

Settable parameters:
<rep>: number of repetitions, 1 to 99. Default is 2. 
<intp>: integration period, 1 to 10 seconds. Default is 1. 
<dev1>: device to be used as the detector 1: VCxx, IFx. The indicated 
        device must set up. The IFD must be setup and in remote. Default 
        is I1.
<dev2>: device to be used as the detector 2: VCxx, IFx. The indicated 
        device must set up. The IFD must be setup and in remote.
        Default is I2.
<cutoff>: elevation above which to step in elevation rather than azimuth
<stp>: distance off source for off source and calibration points, in 
       multiples of a beamwidth. Default is 5.0

Monitor-only parameters:
<cal1>: calibration noise source temperature in degrees K for detector 1. 
        This is determined from the last CALTEMP1 and CALTEMP2 commands in
        conjunction with the PATCH command.
<cal2>: calibration noise source temperature in degrees K for detector 2. 
        This is determined from the last CALTEMP1 and CALTEMP2 commands in
        conjunction with the PATCH command.
<beam1>: The full width half maximum beam size (degrees) for device 1. It is
         determined from the PATCH and FLUXn commands.
<beam2>: The full width half maximum beam size (degrees) for device 2. It is
         determined from the PATCH and FLUXn commands.
<flux1>: The apparent source flux for device 1, based on the PATCH and FLUXn
         commands.
<flux2>: The apparent source flux for device 2, based on the PATCH and FLUXn
         commands.

     Comments: The parameters should be setup by issuing a ONOFF=... command.
A measurement is started by issuing a simple ONOFF, this will recover the 
current values for the display only parameters and schedule an external 
program ONOFF. ONOFF must be RP'd before issuing the command. ONOFF should be
placed in (FSPGM, so that it is RP'd automatically when the Field System is
started.

The current command antenna position including offsets is assumed to be
'onsource.'

It is recommended that nothing else be done, e.g. running a schedule, while 
this command is executing. Since this command may run for an extended period 
of time, a mechanism has been supplied for aborting: enter BR,ONOFF in 
response to a system prompt. After aborting, the offsets will be returned to
their original values.

In order for this command to work, the following conditions must be meet: (1)
the detector devices have been setup by the field system, (2) the LO command
has been issued, (3) the IFD has been setup by the field system and is in 
remote, and (4) the appropriate BEAMn command has been issued. Additionally, 
if a VC is used as a detector, the PATCH command must have been issued. If 
system performance is to be estimated based on the source's apparent flux, 
then the appropriate FLUXn command must have been issued.

Two procedures must be available: CALONNF and CALOFFNF, which are used to turn
the noise diode on and off respectively. The recommended form for these
procedures is:

CALONNF:    CALON
            !+1S 
            SY=GO,ONOFF

CALOFFNF:   CALOFF
            !+1S 
            SY=GO,ONOFF

CALON and CALOFF are local procedures that do whatever is necessary to turn 
the noise source on and off.
