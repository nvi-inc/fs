     label - enter tape number and check-label (non-S2 drive)

Syntax:     label=number,check

Response:   label/number,check


Settable parameters:
number      8 or 10-character tape number, e.g. HS001234
check       4-character check-label corresponding to number e.g.
            8E45. If no check label appears on the tape, run
            program labck to generate it.

Comments: 
Normally used after newtape command has halted the schedule. There
are two different modes of operation depending on whether the tape
number has 8 or 10 characters. When the label command is entered
directly by the operator, 8-character tape numbers are used. Tape
number and check label must correspond or execution of schedule
will not continue. The effect of this command is the same as that
of cont. Digit zeros (0) and letters Os are both treated as zeros
in both number and check for operator convenience.

The ten-character mode will normally be used only by the rwand
program. In this mode, the first eight characters of number
correspond to the tape number, while the tenth character is used
for a checksum. Any other parameters are ignored. A fake
check-label code will be generated if the checksum is correct.
