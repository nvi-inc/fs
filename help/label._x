      label - enter tape VSN and check-label (non-S2 drive)

Syntax:     label=vsn,check,type

Response:   label/vsn,check,type


Settable parameters:
vsn         8 or 10-character tape VSN, e.g. HS001234
check       4-character check-label corresponding to VSN e.g. 8E45.
            If no check label appears on the tape, run program
            labck to generate it.
type        thick or thin, defaults to type implied by VSN. For
            monitor this value only appears until the tape is
            loaded with a rec=load command. This parameter is not
            available unless vacuum switching is enabled in sw.ctl
            control file.

Comments: 
Normally used after newtape command has halted the schedule. There
are two different modes of operation depending on whether the
Volume Serial Number (VSN) has 8 or 10 characters. When the label
command is entered directly by the operator, 8-character VSN are
used. Tape number and check label must correspond or execution of
schedule will not continue. The effect of this command is the same
as that of cont. Digit zeros (0) and letters Os are both treated as
zeros in both number and check for operator convenience.

The ten-character mode will normally be used only by the rwand
programor a bar code reader. In this mode, the first eight
characters of vsn correspond to the tape number, while the tenth
character is used for a barcode checksum. Any other parameters are
ignored. A fake, but correct, check-label code will be generated if
the barcode checksum is correct.

For VLBA drives and specially equipped Mark IV drives that use
vacuum switching, this command is used specify whether the thick or
thin vacuum level (and for VLBA drives thickness parameters as
well) are commanded. Please see the rec command for more details.
