Comments:
The in2net command can be used to transfer data from the Mark 5 input
to the network, another Mark 5 is expected to be receiving the data at
the other end. This transfer can not be done while the system is
recording or performing some other type of Mark 5 data operation, such
as recording. The data transfer can not be interrupted by other data
operations or configuration changes.

The destination parameter is ignored on command unless control is
connect.

The "options" settable parameter is currently ignored, but is included
for future expansion.
