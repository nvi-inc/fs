                cable - get the cable cal reading

Syntax:     cable=message

Response:   cable/value


Settable parameters:
message     ASCII character to be sent to counter.

Monitor-only parameters:
value       cable cal reading

Comments: 
When issued with no parameters this command sends a request for a
reading to the HPIB counter which is connected to the phase cal
cable measurement system.

The ibad.ctl control file must contain an entry with mnemonic CA
and the device name.

If your counter returns a non-standard response, you can control
the parsing of the response by placing the uncommented line below
in your stcmd.ctl file:

*command     seg sbpa bo eq
cable        qkr 13xx 01 FFFFFF

where xx is the number of the character position to begin
decoding at. The first character position is counted as position
1. If the value of xx is 00 decoding will begin at the first
character from the left that could be part of a number in
scientific notation ("0123456789.+-Ee").   The FS uses a value of
04 for xx by default.
