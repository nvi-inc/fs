Syntax:   REPRO=<bypass>,<trackA>,<trackB>,<bandwidth>,
            <equalizer> 
Response: REPRO/<bypass>,<trackA>,<trackB>,<bandwidth>,
            <equalizer>

Settable parameters:
<bypass>: BYP for bypass read-after-write, RAW for
          read-after-write. Default BYP.
<trackA>: track for decoder channel A, default 1, 0-28 allowed.
<trackB>: track for decoder channel B, default 1, 0-28 allowed.
<bandwidth>: bandwidth for decoding, default 2.
<equalizer>: equalizer for reproduce, default same as bandwidth

      Comments: MAT module functions available. The reproduce mode
is set to RAW when the ST=FOR command is executed. It is set to BYP
when the commands ST=REV, ET, FF, or RW are executed.

Selection of track 0 for a decoder channel will disable that
channel until another track is selected.
