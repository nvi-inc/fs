              check - modules to be checked by chekr
 
              Syntax:      check=list
 
              Response:    check/list
 
 
 Settable parameters:
        list   The list of mnemonics for modules to be checked. Only
        mnemonics for the equipment identified in the
        equip.ctl control file are valid in this command.
        Standard module mnemonics are allowed. If the list of
        modules to be checked is empty, then chekr will not
        check any modules.
 
 Monitor-only parameters: none
 
 Comments: 
 As modules are set up by SNAP commands, they are automatically
 added to the list of modules being checked by chekr. This
 command can be used to remove and reinstate modules on the
 list.
 
 The entire list of modules to be checked may always be
 specified by listing the appropriate modules. However, the
 list of modules already being checked may also be modified by
 entering * as the first parameter, followed by the list of
 modules to be added or deleted from the existing list.
 Deletion is indicated by a leading minus sign. For example,
 
                         check=*,ifd,-rc
 
 will cause the IF distributor to be added to the list of
 modules being checked and the tape transport to be removed
 from the list, while the check status of all other modules
 remain unchanged.
 
 If no modules are currently being checked then the word
 disabled is displayed.
 
 The displayed list of modules always consists of the standard
 2-character mnemonic, i.e. the ones listed on the reference
 page at the front of this manual. Station-specific mnemonics
 may be used for station-specific modules.
 
 Note: In the current Field System version, for VLBA systems,
 the head position is checked but only some of the DAR module
 and REC functions are checked.
