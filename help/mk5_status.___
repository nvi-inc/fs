	 mk5_status - Mark 5 (ABC) "status?" + "error?" query

            Syntax:     mk5_status

            Response:   mk5_status/status,0xXXXXXXXX,<pending>
                        mk5_status/error,<number>,<error text>

Monitor-only parameters:
            status        literal string "status" indicating that
                          this is a device status report line
            0xXXXXXXXX    hex status word
            <pending>     literal string: "error(s) pending" is printed
                          if error bit, 0x2, is set in the staturs word
            error         literal string "error" indicating that
                          this is a device error report line
            <number>      the Mark 5 error number of the error
            <error text>  the text for the error reported by Mark 5

Comments: This command will produce status and error report lines in
pairs until all errors (to a maximum of five in a single invocation)
have been reported, concluding with a final status report line showing
a status word. If there are no more errors to report the status work
will not have the the error bit set (0x2). If the last reported status
message shows more errors pending, a warning is issued.  This command
returns only the current status if there is no error.

The rationale for the error queueing/retrieval mechanism is that
sometimes (hardware) errors may happen in the background, without
being the direct cause of a command or query.  All Mark 5 control
software support this mechanism, although not all of them provide the
queueing facility of multiple errors.  Depending on the actual control
code driving the Mark 5 this command may ("jive5ab") or may not
(Mark5A/DIMino) return more than one error at a time.

An example where this can can be useful is running out of disk space
during a "disk2file" command.  The "disk2file?" query only indicates
whether a "disk2file" is currently active but not the reason of
inactivity, should it not be active.  Thus if a "disk2file" terminates
because of an error, this fact would go by completely unnoticed.

To allow users to retrieve errors like these, the Mark 5 control
software retains an internal queue of errors (in Mark5A/DIMino it is
limited to a length of one) that have happened in the background.  If
the queue is non-empty, this fact will be reflected in the error bit
in the status word being set.  The actual error code and message can
then be retrieved using the "error?" query.

This "mk5_status" SNAP command will first retrieve the (hexadecimal)
status word and log it.  Should the error bit be set, it follows up by
sending an "error?" query to the Mark 5 to retrieve and log the actual
error.  This sequence repeats until the error bit is cleared.  Thus,
if called, "mk5_status" will clear the error queue.

It is advised to run this command at regular intervals (typically during
"checkmk5") in order to identify errors that may be occurring and in what
scan they occurred.
