              onsource - get antenna pointing status

            Syntax:     onsource
                        onsource=time-out,on-command,off-command

            Response:   onsource/status


Settable Parameters:
              time-out:     Time-out for the source condition, seconds, 0-86400,
                            Default 0.
              on-command:    Command to execute if status is tracking, i.e.,
                            "on". Default is no command.
              off-command:   Command to execute if status is slewing, i.e.,
                            "off". Default is no command.

Monitor-only Parameters:
              status        tracking or slewing, depending on the errors in
              pointing.

Comments:

The form without parameters is used to check the current onsource
status. An error message is generated if the status is slewing.

The form with parameters can be used to cause the command stream to
pause until the source is reached or the time-out time expires,
whichever is first.  The second and third parameters are executed as
commands in the operator stream depending on whether the status of
tracking is achieved (on-command) or not (off-command).  If the
time-out is zero, the onsource status is checked and the appropriate
supplied command, if any, is executed.

Note that since the commands are executed in operator stream, they are
not necessarily useful from within a schedule.  However, when used in
operator stream (manually entered or an operator executed SNAP
procedure), the form with parameters can be used to construct an
awkward, but workable conditional execution mechanism based on the
onsource status. One way to do this is to place the command at the end
of a SNAP procedure to link to the next SNAP procedure in a sequence or a
termination procedure if onsource was not achieved. For example:

  onsource=60,next,end

where the time-out was sent to 60 seconds and the procedure (or
command) "next" is executed next if onsource "tracking" was achieved
or a clean-up procedure (or command) "end" is executed if not. This
approach can lead to having a series of small procedure that do each
step of a more complicated sequence.  A more compact approach would be
to just use the time-out to delay the execution of the next command in
a procedure until onsource is reach, e.g.:

  onsource=60

However, this approach does not provide any error recovery.

Care must be taken when using non-zero time-out since that can cause
the FS to effectively "stop" for a long period of time.  Generally,
this is only useful to help automate local ad hoc measurement
procedures with the antenna.  Non-zero times should not be used in
observing schedules.

Since a non-zero time-out can cause the command to execute for a long
time, an option has been included to interrupt execution by sending a
"break".  From a Linux shell prompt, enter:

  brk quikr

Note that you cannot send the "break" with the "sy=..." command since
the FS is tied up executing the onsource command and will not process
the "sy=..."  until it finishes.

The form without parameters is equivalent to:

   onsource=0

When a non-zero time-out is used, the antcn program is used in mode 5
(no extended error messages) instead of mode 3 (extended error
messages) used when the time-out is zero.
