The display format for MCB communications when echo=on has
been issued is as follows. Each byte of the communication is
displayed as

     bytes sent to the MCB            [nxx]
     bytes received from the MCB      <nxx>

where n is normally a blank. n is + when data is being written to
the module. The address or data is xx, represented as two hex
characters. Control function bytes are displayed with special 3-
letter mnemonics:

        [SYN]      hex 16     synchronization byte
        <ACK>      hex 06     acknowledge
        <NAK>      hex 15     not acknowledge
        <DC1>      hex 11     data control 1
        <DC2>      hex 12     data control 2
