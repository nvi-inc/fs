Syntax:         echo=set

Response:       none


Settable parameters:

                communications are echoed on the operator's terminal.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
Immediate execution operator command for MAT and/or MCB communications and, at
some stations, antenna communications also.

For MCB communications, each byte is displayed as

     bytes sent to the MCB              [nxx]
     bytes received from the MCB        <nxx>

where n is normally a blank. n is + for the first byte of the address when data
is being written to the module. The address or data is xx, represented as two
hex characters. MCB control bytes are displayed with special 3-letter mnemonics:

        [SYN]      hex 16    synchronization byte
        <ACK>      hex 06    acknowledge
        <NAK>      hex 15    not acknowledge
        <DC1>      hex 11    data control 1
        <DC2>      hex 12    data control 2

For MAT communications, most of the data bytes are printable ASCII characters
which are displayed simply as the character. The unprintable ASCII characters are
displayed as [xxx], where xxx is shown in the table below. The "del" character
(127) is displayed as [del].
