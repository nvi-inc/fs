                     rcl - RCL communications

Syntax:     rcl=device,command,parameters,...

Response:   rcl=response


Settable Parameters:
device      The two character module mnemonic for the device to
            communicate with as defined in the rclad.ctl control
            file, e.g. rc for the S2 recorder.

command   Name of RCL command function.

parameters  Command delimited additional parameters required for
            this RCL command function.

Monitor-only Parameters: 
response    Result of communication, may displayed on multiple
            lines for ease of reading. 

Comments: 
This command implements access to all the low-level functions of
the RCL interface. Check ISTS's S2-RT User's Manual, Appendix A for
detailed information about the command names, their parameters,
and the responses. The following table lists very briefly the
commands and the parameters, if any, that the rcl command expects
for each. For parameters that have values that consist of choice
among fixed items, it is possible to enter a numeric value as
well, in which case it is passed directly to RCL interface
without checking.
