TAPE - Low-tape/footage control and monitor

Syntax:   TAPE=<lowtape>,<reset>
Response: TAPE/<lowtape>,<footage>,<fast>,<capstan>,<stop>,
            <tach>,<ready>,<lcl/rem>

Settable parameters:
<lowtape>: if OFF, tape may run off end of reel. If LOW, end of
           tape will be sensed. Default LOW. As monitor, this tells
           whether tape is actually at the low-tape point, i.e. OFF
           means not at low-tape.
<reset>: RESET to reset footage counter to 0, blank to leave
         counter alone. As monitor, this gives the actual footage
         count.

Monitor-only parameters:
<fast>:    fast tape switch on front panel, FAST or NORmal.
<capstan>: capstan MOVING, or STOP has been completed.
<stop>:    STOP has been issued, or NONSTOP.
<tach>:    tach is LOCKed or UNLOCKed, i.e. tape is up to speed.
<ready>:   tape drive vacuum is READY or NOTREADY.
<lcl/rem>: switch setting, REMote or LoCaL.

      Comments: MAT module functions available.
