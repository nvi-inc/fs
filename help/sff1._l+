 Parameters: none
 
 Comments:
 The tape is started moving forward at super high speed. For
 Mark III and Mark IV drives, the record bit is disabled and
 the low tape sensor is turned on. For VLBA and VLBA4 drives,
 all track groups are disabled and the low tape sensor is
 turned on. For Mark IV and VLBA4 racks the formatter output is
 disabled
 
 The tape is moved at the "super" speed value as specified in
 the equip.ctl control file. This is the fastest speed that
 your tape drive can manage, normally 330 ips.
 
 Use the ff command and fastf procedure for positioning the
 tape during a schedule.
