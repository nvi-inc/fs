PARITY - Measure and check parity errors

Syntax:   PARITY=<pemax>,<syncmax>,<channel>,<aux>,<list of tracks>
Response: PARITY/<list of parity errors by track>
          PARITY/<list of sync errors by track>

Settable Parameters:
<pemax>: maximum allowable parity errors per channel per megabyte
         of data. Default is 600. If errors exceed threshold, an
         error message is issued.
<syncmax>: default is 12. Otherwise handled the same as parity error
         threshold.
<channel>: decoder channel, default AB. Can be A, B, or AB.
<aux>: AUX data check, ON or OFF, default ON.
<list of tracks>: list of recorder tracks on which to measure
         errors. Default is the currently enabled tracks. Values
         must be between 1 and 28, and/or may be specified by
         groups (G1,G2,G3,G4) as in the ENABLE command.

Monitor-only parameters:
<list of parity errors>: for each track in the list, the
         corresponding parity errors (smallest of 4 samples).
<list of sync errors>: for each track in the list, the
         corresponding sync errors (smallest observed value over
         the same 4 sample intervals as the parity error check).

      Comments: Issuing this command with a list of tracks (or
PARITY= for currently enabled tracks) sets up the command. Issuing
the command with no parameters then measures errors.

If the auxiliary data field was set using the FORM or head positioning
commands, then it is checked for accuracy, unless the <AUX> parameter 
is OFF. An error message is issued if the auxiliary data on the tape 
does not agree with the value last sent to the formatter.

If so many tracks are decoded that the response extends beyond
about 100 characters, then another response line is generated.

The decoder channels used to read the data can be specified, either the 
A, B, or both A and B reproduce channels can be used. If PCALR 
or the DTE program is running, it should be suspended before starting 
this command so that there's no competition for the B channel.

The command can be aborted while running by getting a system prompt
and typing "BR,QUIKR".
