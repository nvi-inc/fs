decode - decoder control and monitor(Mark III rack)

Syntax:      decode=channel,mode,counter

Response:    decode/channel,mode,data


Settable parameters:
channel         Channel a (default) or b to be decoded.
mode            Type of data to be read. Choices are auxilliary data,
                synch, crc word, time, data bits, or error counts
                (default). 
counter         Error counter control: byte (default), frame, reset.

Monitor-only parameters:
data            Data returned according to mode specified in control
                command.
                   err     sspppppp (s=synch errors, p=parity errors)
                           Note that monitored error values are error
                           counts, not rates.
                   syn     8 - character synch word
                   time    two words: ydddhhmm and sssssccc, where
                           ccc = checksum
                   data    three sets of 32 data bits
                   aux     two sets of 8 characters of auxiliary data
                   crc     pass/fail for CRC check

Comments: 
MAT module functions available. CRC check is reliable only in bypass
reproduce mode.
