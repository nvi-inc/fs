          ifx - IF distributor (DBBC3 racks)

            Syntax:     ifx=input,att,target
            Response:   ifx/input,att,target,attV,counts


'x' is the IFD index letter corresponding to its order in position in
the DBBC3 rack, 'a' to 'h'

Settable Parameters:

            input     input, 1 to 2, No default.

            att       attenuation, "man" for manual control at current
                      level, "agc" for automatic gain control, or 0-63
                      which represent steps of 0.5 dB. A numeric value
                      implies manual control. On monitor, only "agc"
                      or "man" are displayed (attV monitor parameter
                      is the current value).  Default is "agc".

            target    level target for AGC, 0-65535. Default is not to
                      command. This normally is not set here, but by
                      the DBBC3's configuration file.

Monitor-only Parameters:

            attV      attenuation value, 0-63 which represent
		      steps of 0.5 dB. The value adjusts as the DBBC3
                      tracks the target in AGC mode.

            counts    Level in the bandpass for one second integration
                      in counts. Range 0 to 65535. The value tracks the
                      target level in AGC mode.

Comments:
Each IF module has two inputs: input '1' does not include down
conversion, input '2' includes down conversion.

The DBBC3 dbbcifX command has a filter parameter that is not useful.
However, on command it must be specified or the following parameter,
target, will be ignored. The FS always sends "1" as the filter value
if a target is specified. The filter value returned by the DBBC3 is
not displayed in FS monitor output.

The nominal target for 4 GHz BW input signal is 32000. For a 1 GHz BW input
signal around 22000 might be good. For 0.5 GHZ input BW signal, 10000 may be
realistic. A value that is too high will drive the samplers into saturation and
cause gain compression.
