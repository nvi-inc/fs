                   k4ib - K4 IB Communications
 
              Syntax:      k4ib=device,command,mode,format,length
 
              Response:    k4ib/data
 
 
 Settable parameters:
            device     mnemonic of device on K-4 bus from ibad.ctl to send
            data to, may be null if mode=poll and must be null
            for mode=status
            command    data to send, null if mode=poll or status or read
          mode     Function: normal (default), read, write, write/read,
          poll, or status
            format     response format: normal (default), ascii, or binary
            length     response length: normal (default), decimal value
 
 Comments:
 The mode, format, and length parameters are organized so that as
 often as possible they can be omitted. 
 
 If mode is normal, the interpretation depends on the command
 sent: if command contains a ? or is stat, rd, lc, or lv, the
 mode defaults to write/read, otherwise if command is null it
 defaults to read, non-null write.
 
 If  format is normal, the interpretation depends on the command
 sent: if command contains stat or err? or if mode is poll or
 status, the format defaults to binary, otherwise to ascii
 
 If length is normal, the interpretation depends on the command
 sent: if command is rd the length defaults to 192, if lv to
 143, otherwise to 22,. The lengthis meaningless if command is
 poll or status.
 
 If the device is omitted and the mode is poll, all devices are
 polled and, their status bytes are returned in the order of
 ascending ib addresses. If a device times-out on a poll
 operation, a "-1" is
 reported for its status byte.
 
 If the mode is status, the response returns the bus status.
 
 In general mroe than one command can be sent if they are
 separated by semicolons, but do not mix commands that require
 different modes or more than one response in a single command.
 
 See the documentation of the K4 devices for information on
 what commands are available.
