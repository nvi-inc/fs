srw - super fast-rewind
Syntax:      srw

Response:    srw/acknowledgement


Parameters: none

Comments:
The tape is started moving in reverse at super high speed. For
Mark III, the record bit is disabled and the low tape sensor is
turned on. For VLBA, all track groups are disabled and the low
tape sensor is turned on.

The tape is moved at the "super" speed value as specified in the
equip.ctl control file. This is the fastest speed that your tape drive
can manage, normally 330 ips.

Use the rw command and fastr procedure for positioning the
tape during a schedule.
