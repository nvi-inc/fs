STACK - Narrow track head positioning by microns

Syntax:   STACK=<cmdMw>,<cmdMr>,<calW>,<calR>
          STACK
Response: STACK/<cmdMw>,<cmdMr>,<calW>,<calR>,<actMw>,
          <actMr>,<deltaMw>,<deltaMr>

Settable parameters:
<cmdMw>: Write command position in microns. Default is not to move.
<cmdMr>: Read command position in microns. Default is not to move.
<calW>: Write head calibration to use: Forward, Reverse, or Uncalibrated.
        Only the first letter is checked. Default is Uncalibrated.
<calR>: Write head calibration to use: Forward, Reverse, or Uncalibrated.
        Only the first letter is checked. Default is Uncalibrated.

Monitor-only parameters:
<actMw>: Actual write head position, microns.
<actMr>: Actual read head position, microns.
<deltaMw>: Difference of actual and commanded position for write 
     head, microns.
<deltaMr>: Difference of actual and commanded position for read 
     head, microns.

Comments: This command is used to position the narrow track head stacks
in micron units. An individual head may be moved by not specifying the
command position and calibration to use for the other head.

The <delta> parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus commanded.

The command positions reported by the LVDT, PASS, and STACK commands are
consistent. See the description of the PASS command for more information.

If the heads were last positioned with the PASS or LVDT commands, the response
<calW> and <calR> will correctly identify the calibration used. Odd pass
numbers will be reported as `forward' calibrations, even passes as `reverse'
calibrations. Positions commanded with the LVDT command are `uncalibrated.'

If the write head position is commanded, the auxiliary data field is set
to reflect the commanded position, see the PASS command for more information.
