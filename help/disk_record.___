               disk_record - Start/stop Mark 5 recording

            Syntax:     disk_record=record,label

            Response:   disk_record/record,label,scan


Settable Parameters:
          record    One of: on or off. No default. Additional monitor only
                    values: halted, throttled, overflow, and waiting
          label     String of up to 63 characters, default comes
                    from scan_name command

Monitor-only parameters:
          scan      sequential scan number


Comments: The default for the label come from the scan_name command.
It consists of session, station, and name parameters from the
scan_name command concatentaed together in that order, seperated by
underscores, i.e.: session_station_name.

The record monitor parameter values of halted, throttled, overflow,
and waiting all indicate errors.

If recording is aborted because of some problem before the
"disk_record=off" command is executed by the Mark 5A, then all data
recorded since the previous "disk_record=on" may be lost.  If you are
using the "2004y351d" (16December2004) version, or a later version, of
the Mark5A program, then as described below, in most of these cases,
it is possible to update the record pointer (but not the directory) on
the disk pack to reflect the data that had been recorded.  This
procedure will prevent the data from being overwritten by new
recordings and allow the data from the aborted recording to be
correlated.  This command seems to work well in at least two cases:
(1) the Mark5A program is ended prematurely by crash or some other
problem or (2) the power is lost to the Mark5A unit.  It does not seem
work as well in the case where the key switch is turned off during
recording (care should be exercised of course to avoid turning the key
switch on the selected disk pack).  Regardless of the cause of the
aborted recording, the best recovery procedure is to execute the
following FS commands (after re-starting the Mark5A program):

  mk5=bank_set=<bank with aborted recording>;
  mk5=recover=0

If you do not know which bank has the aborted recording, it is
probably the one that is neither empty nor full.  You can use the
monit5 'disk space remaining' display and the 'bank_status' command to
see which bank is neither empty (100% remaining) nor full (0.x%
remaining).  If recording aborted during the first scan, then that
bank would show 100% remaining.

It is probably not worthwhile to recover short recordings particularly
if doing so would prevent other scans from being recorded. However,
for longer recordings, particularly if several scans have been
recorded "continuously" and a problem prevented a proper
"disk_record=off", recovery may be helpful. Since at this time
directory information is not recovered properly, this won't be helpful
for scans transferred off-line after an experiment with software that
depends on the directory information. In that case, the transfer will
not work, but this will at least preserve the data on disk.

The Mark5A "recover" command is available with the "2004y351d"
(16December2004) or later versions of the Mark5A program. It is
documented in the "Mark 5A command set" document
