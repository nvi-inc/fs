              terminate - end field system operation

            Syntax:     terminate
                        terminate=okay

            Response:   none


Settabel Parameters:
       okay            literal ascii: disk_record_ok

Comments: 
This is the graceful way to end operation of the Field System.
Schedule execution is ended, log and schedule files are
closed, all programs are removed from the system by oprin.

The terminate command will not succeed if disk record has been
commanded with the disk_record=on command.  Either recording must be
stopped using disk_record=off first or if you wish to continue
recording despite terminating the FS, you can use
"terminate=disk_record_ok".
