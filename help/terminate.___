            Syntax:     terminate
                        terminate=force

            Response:   none


Settabel Parameters:
       force           literal text: force

Comments: 
This is the graceful way to end operation of the Field System.
Schedule execution is ended, log and schedule files are closed, all
online FS programs are removed from the system.

The 'terminate' command will not succeed if: (i) recording has been
commanded with the 'disk_record=on', (ii) an instance of 'autoftp' is
active, (iii) an instance of 'fs.prompt' is active, or (iv) 'pfmed' is
active.

If it is appropriate to do so, the first three conditions can be
corrected by: (i) stopping recording with 'disk_record=off', (ii)
waiting for all instances of 'autoftp' to finish, or (iii) closing all
instances of 'fs.prompt'. Alternately, 'terminate=force' can override
the first three conditions and force termination immediately, but this
may cause other problems related to the conditions that were
preventing termination.

There is no way to override 'pfmed' being active stopping termination.
To correct that condition, exit that utility.
