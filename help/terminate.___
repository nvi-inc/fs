              terminate - end field system operation

            Syntax:     terminate
                        terminate=force

            Response:   none


Settable Parameters:
       force           literal text: force

Comments: 
This is the graceful way to end operation of the Field System.
Schedule execution is ended, log and schedule files are closed, all
online FS programs are removed from the system.

There are four conditions that can stop 'terminate' from succeeding.
The first two are:

 (i) 'pfmed' being active
(ii) recording having been commanded with 'disk_record=on'

If the display server is in use, termination will also be blocked if:

(iii) any instances of 'autoftp' are active
 (iv) any instances of 'fs.prompt' are active

If it is appropriate, the four conditions can be corrected by:

  (i) exiting 'pfmed'
 (ii) using 'disk_record=off' to stop recording
(iii) waiting for all instances of 'autoftp' to finish
 (iv) closing all instances of 'fs.prompt'

Alternately, if it is necessary to terminate immediately, the last
three conditions can be overridden with 'terminate=force', but this
may cause other problems related to the conditions that were
preventing termination. The user should be careful.

There is no way to override the condition for 'pfmed' being active;
the program must be exited. This condition is checked before the
others since there is no point using 'force' if 'pfmed' is going to
block termination anyway.
