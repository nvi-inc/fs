HDATA - Head positioner A/D data readout

Syntax:   HDATA
Response: HDATA/<hd0p>,<hd1p>,<hd0t>,<hd1t>,<vac>,<oddpwr>,<evpwr>,<ref>

Settable parameters:  none

Monitor-only parameters:
<hd0p>: Head 0 position
<hd1p>: Head 1 position
<hd0t>: Head 0 temperature
<hd1t>: Head 1 temperature
<vac>: vacuum sensor
<oddpwr>: odd reproduce power
<evpwr>: even reproduce power
<ref>: reference voltage

Comments: MAT module functions available.

This command reads the Head Positioner A/D channels, all values are reported
in units of volts.  Data from all channels are reported regardless of whether
anything is hooked up to them or not. In particular, most stations do not
use the temperature channels, the vacuum sensor, and one of the reproduce
power channels.

The position voltages (and all others) are reported with the LVDT off.
