ff - fast-forward the tape
Syntax:         ff

Response:       ff/acknowledgement


Parameters: none

Comments:
The tape is moved forward at high speed. For Mark III, the record bit is disabled
and the low tape sensor is turned on. For VLBA, all track groups are disabled and
the low tape sensor is turned on.

The tape is moved at the "schedule" speed value as specified in the equip.ctl
control file. This is the speed assumed in the SNAP schedule file for positioning
the tape with the fastf procedure.

Use the sff command and sfastf procedure for possibly faster tape motion.
