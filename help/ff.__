                    ff - fast-forward the tape

Syntax:     ff

Response:   ff/acknowledgement


Parameters: none

Comments:
The tape is moved forward at high speed. For Mark III, the record
bit is disabled and the low tape sensor is turned on. For VLBA, all
track groups are disabled and the low tape sensor is turned on. 

For S2 drives, the selected transports are moved forward at the
transport's fast forward speed.

For drives other that the S2, the tape is moved at the "schedule"
speed value as specified in the equip.ctl control file. This is the
speed assumed in the SNAP schedule file for positioning the tape
with the fastf procedure.

Use the sff command and sfastf procedure for possibly faster tape
motion.
