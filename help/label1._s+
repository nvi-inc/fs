           label - enter tape VSN and type (S2 drives)
 
              Syntax:      label=vsn,type,code
 
              Response:    label=vsn,type,code
 
 
 Settable parameters:
          vsn      up to 20 character Volume Serial Number (VSN), e.g.
          CA-1-0012305.
          type     one or six character tape type, e.g. 1, or 010020.
          This field may be omitted if code is csa. If not
          omitted and code is csa, it must agree with the type
          specified in the vsn.
        code   tape label format, an arbitrary string up to 32
        characters, default is csa.
 
 Comments:
 Normally used after newtape command has halted the schedule.
 
 If code is casa, vsn is interpreted as a CSA format, "XX-T-
 YYYYYZZ-N" label. The "XX-T-YYYYZZ" part of the label uniquely
 identifies this as a set of eight tapes. The check-sum is
 checked. If type is specified it must agree with the "T" type
 from the vsn, unless six characters are specified for type. If
 type is not specified, the single character "T" from the vsn is
 used as the typ. The suffix "-N" must be omitted if all eight
 tapes in a set are loaded, even if they will not all be
 recorded as one group. If fewer than eight tapes are loaded,
 which tapes are inserted and the order of their insertion in
 the transports should be specified in the suffix. For example
 if the first four tapes in a set are inserted in order the
 suffix "-0123" should be used. When fewer than eight tapes are
 inserted they should be inserted in ascending order and must
 go into consecutive transports in ascending order starting
 with transport 0. Loading the tapes in this way and using the
 suffix as described is necessary in order for the correlator
 to load the tapes for playback based only on information
 available in the log. In addition, if the tapes are not
 inserted in consecutive transports beginning with transport 0,
 the schedule will probably fail.
 
 For all other values of code, vsn may be an arbitrary string up
 to 20 characters long, but type must be specified in this case.
 
 If the recorder is already recording and a tape type different
 than what is in use is requested, no change will be made and
 an error will be reported.
