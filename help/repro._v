           repro - set up reproduce tracks (VLBA drive)

Syntax:     repro=modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB

Response:   repro/modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB


Settable parameters:
modeA Reproduce mode for channel A. byp (default) for bypass, raw
      or read for read (playback).
trackA    Track for decoder channel A, default 1, 0-35 allowed.
trackB    Track for decoder channel B, default 1, 0-35 allowed.
modeB Reproduce mode for channel B. byp for bypass, raw or read
      for read (playback). Default is modeA.
equA    Equalizer to use for decoding channel A. For VLBA
        recorders: alt1 (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt2
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified. For VLBA2
        recorders: std (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt1
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified.Additional
        values of 1,  0.5, and 0.25 (MHz track bandwidth) may be
        specified for bypass reproduce of these channel bandwidths.
        For these additional values the monitor value is always the
        default.
equB    Equalizer to use for decoding channel B. For VLBA
        recorders: alt1 (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt2
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified. For VLBA2
        recorders: std (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt1
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified. Additional
        values of 1,  0.5, and 0.25 (MHz track bandwidth) may be
        specified for bypass reproduce. For these additional values
        the monitor value is always the default.


Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The raw or read mode normally is used only when checking parity
errors on the tape. This is also known as "playback" mode.

This command also sets up the clock recovery chip. The value that
is set depends on the choice of the equA equalizer. The 135 ips
equalizer selects a 4 Mb/sec (2 MHz track bandwidth)   set-up. The
270 ips equalizer selects a 8 Mb/sec (4 MHz track bandwidth) set-up. It is also possible to specify  track bandwidths of 1, 0.5 and
0.25 MHz explicitly for the equalizer to set the clock recovery
chip for the corresponding bit rate. However, for these bandwidths
there is no appropriate equalizer, so the equalizer itself is set
to the default and that value is always shown for the monitor value
(but the command value will be shown as the value requested).
