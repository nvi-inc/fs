repro - set up reproduce tracks (VLBA drive)
Syntax:      repro=modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB

Response:    repro/modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB


Settable parameters:
modeA          reproduce mode for channel A. byp (default) for bypass,
               raw or read for read (playback).
trackA         track for decoder channel A, default 1, 1-28 allowed.
trackB         track for decoder channel B, default 1, 1-28 allowed.
modeB          reproduce mode for channel B. byp for bypass, raw or
               read for read (playback). Default is modeA.
equA           equalizer to use for decoding channel A. alt1 (default) for
               normal speed (135 ips), alt2 for double speed (270 ips),
               std unspecified.
equB           equalizer to use for decoding channel B. alt1 for normal
               speed (135 ips), alt2 for double speed (270 ips), std
               unspecified. Default is equA.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The raw or read mode normally is used only when checking parity errors on
the tape. This is also known as "playback" mode.

This command sets the code for the AT&T bit synchronizer chip. The value
that is set depends on the choice of the equA equalizer.
