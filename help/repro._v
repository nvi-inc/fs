           repro - set up reproduce tracks (VLBA drive)

Syntax:     repro=modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB

Response:   repro/modeA,trackA,trackB,modeB,equA,equB


Settable parameters:
modeA   Reproduce mode for channel A. byp (default) for bypass,
        raw or read for read (playback).
trackA    Track for decoder channel A, default 1, 0-35 allowed.
trackB    Track for decoder channel B, default 1, 0-35 allowed.
modeB   Reproduce mode for channel B. byp for bypass, raw or read
        for read (playback). Default is modeA.
equA    Equalizer to use for decoding channel A. For VLBA
        recorders: alt1 (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt2
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified. For VLBA2
        recorders: std (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt1
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified.
equB    Equalizer to use for decoding channel B. For VLBA
        recorders: alt1 (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt2
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified. For VLBA2
        recorders: std (default) for normal speed (135 ips), alt1
        for double speed (270 ips), std unspecified.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
The raw or read mode normally is used only when checking parity
errors on the tape. This is also known as "playback" mode.

This command also sets up the AT&T bit synchronizer chip. The value
that is set depends on the choice of the equA equalizer.
