repro - set up reproduce tracks (Mark III drive)
Syntax:         repro=bypass,trackA,trackB,bandwidth,equalizer 

Response:       repro/bypass,trackA,trackB,bandwidth,equalizer


Settable parameters:
bypass          byp (default) for bypass, raw for read-after-write.
trackA          track for decoder channel A, default 1, 0-28 allowed.
trackB          track for decoder channel B, default 1, 0-28 allowed.
bandwidth       bandwidth for decoding (MHz), default 2.
equalizer       equalizer for reproduce, default same as bandwidth.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
MAT module functions available for Mark III. For VLBA, the bandwidth and
equalizer are not separately commandable.

The raw mode normally is used only when checking parity errors on the tape.

Selection of track 0 for a decoder channel will disable that channel until
another track is selected.
