               beam - set beamsize for flux command

            Syntax:     beam5=angle
          beam6=angle

            Response:   beam5/angle
          beam6/angle


Settable parameters:
          angle     full-width half maximum beam size, displayed in
          decimal degrees of arc.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments:
The beam5/6 commands are used to specify beamsizes for station
specific detectors u5 and u6. They do not correspond to a
standard IF channel, but instead to whatever IF is being
supplied to the corresponding station detector.

The commands flux5/6 use the sizes specified as beam5/6,
respectively, to calculate the apparent flux.

There is no default for the beam size.

Issuing a beam5/6=... command will change the calculated
values of the flux5/6 command to invalid quantities. Reissue a
correct flux5/6=... command to recalculate fluxes.
