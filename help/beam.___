Syntax:     beam1=angle
          beam2=angle
          beam3=angle
          beama=angle
          beamb=angle
          beamc=angle
          beamd=angle
          beam5=angle
          beam6=angle

Response:   beam1/angle
          beam2/angle
          beam3/angle
          beama/angle
          beamb/angle
          beamc/angle
          beamd/angle
          beam5/angle
          beam6/angle


Settable parameters:
angle     full-width half maximum beam size, displayed in decimal
          degrees of arc.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments:
The beam1/2/3 and beama/b/c/d commands are applicable for Mark
III (and Mark IV)  and VLBA (and VLBA4) systems, respectively.
The command pairs beam1/a, beam2/b, and beam3/c are synonymous.

The beam size for the sky frequency for each IF channel may be
specified with these commands. The commands flux1/2/3 and
fluxa/b/c/d use the sizes specified as beam1/2/3 and beama/b/c/d,
respectively, to calculate the apparent flux.

There is no default for the beam size unless the appropriate IF
distributor command (ifd or if3 for Mark III (and Mark IV)
systems, ifab or ifcd for VLBA (and VLBA4) systems) and the lo
commands have been issued.  There is no default for beam5/6, see
below for more detail. If these commands have been issued, then
the beam size will default to the beam size calculated from the
appropriate LO frequencies and the antenna diameter found in the
antenna.ctl control file. The formula is:

            beam size (radians) = 1.05*c/(freq*diaman)

Issuing a beamx=... command will change the calculated values of
the fluxx command to invalid quantities. Reissue a correct
fluxx=... command to recalculate fluxes.

The beam5/6 commands are used for station specific detectors u5
and u6. They do not correspond to a standard IF channel, but
instead to whatever IF is being supplied to the corresponding
station detector.
