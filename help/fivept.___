          Response:   fivept/axis,rep,pts,stp,intp,dev,wait,beam,cal,flux,chain


Settable parameters:
          axis      Axis system for scan. 
                      hadc = Hour Angle/Declination (default)
                      azel = Azimuth/Elevation
                      xyns = X/Y, +X East
                      xyew = X/Y, +X South  (unimplemented)
    `
          rep       Number of repetitions: -10 to -1 and 1 to 10
                    allowed. Default is -2. Negative repetition counts
                    are described in the fivpt manual. The absolute
                    value implies a maximum repetitions count, but once
                    the scans are well entered on both axes,
                    additional repetitions will be skipped.

          pts       Number of points on each axis, if even, it is
                    increased by 1. pts must be between -31 to -3 or  3
                    to 31, inclusive. Default is 7. Negative point
                    counts cause the system temperature measurement to
                    be skipped. The absolute value is used as the number
                    of points.

          stp       Step size for distance between points, in multiples
                    of a beamwidth. Default is 0.5. 

          intp      Integration period, 1 to 32 seconds.

          dev       Mnemonic for the device to be used as the detector.
                    Standard devices are allowed. Note that for Mark III
                    equipment, the whether the video converter USB or
                    LSB detector is used is determined by the vc
                    command. The module which has the specified detector 
                    must have been set up. The IF distributor must be
                    set up and, for Mark III, must be in remote. Default
                    detector is i1 for Mark III/IV, ia for VLBA/4 and DBBC,
                    01a0 for RDBE, and 001u for DBBC3.
                    Station dependent detectors u5 and u6 may be
                    available.
                    'none' is allowed; see Comments.

          wait      seconds to wait for onsource for each point, 1-1200
                    seconds allowed, default 120.

          beam      The full width half maximum beam size in degrees.
                    This is only settable if 'dev' is 'none'. In that
                    case, it is a "fake" antennna beamwidth in
                    degrees.

                    For all other 'dev' devices, this is a
                    monitor-only parameter. See comments.

Display-only parameters:
          cal      Calibration noise source temperature in degrees K.
                   The value is '0' for detector 'none'. See comments,

          flux     The apparent flux of the source. The value
                   is '0' for detector 'none'. See comments.

          chain    The IF chain, 1-8, that the detector is on.
                   Station specific detectors u5 and u6 are on chains
                   '5' and '6'. The value is '0' for detector 'none'.
                   See comments

Comments:
The parameters should be setup with a fivept= command. A scan is
started by issuing a simple fivept command (i.e. with no parameters),
this will determine the current values of the display only parameters
and then schedule an external program, fivpt, which then uses the
Field System to perform the necessary measurements. See the fivept
manual in Volume 2.

The scan is performed about the current commanded position.  Any
offsets that are in use are included. If the scan is successful the
total offsets for the selected axis type are updated.

If 'dev' is 'none', the antenna will be moved, but no data taken.
This can useful for exercising an antenna when there is no rack
available. The usual rack setup is not required. A "fake" antenna
beam-width is specified with the 'beam' parameter. This interacts with
the 'stp' parameter to determine how far the antenna is moved. An
example procedure library file,
'/usr2/fs/st.default/proc/point_no_det.prc', and an example control
file, 'st.default/control/ctlpo_no_det.ctl', are provided for using
this feature with 'acquire'.

For standard detectors the monitor-only parameters 'beam', 'cal',
'flux', and 'chain' are determined from the '.rxg' file, 'flux.ctl'
file, and the LO and rack configuration. For station defined detectors
u5 and u6 the frequency (and 'chain') information comes from the
'user_device=u5,...' and 'user_device=u6,...' commands respectively.

It is recommended that nothing else be done, e.g., running a schedule,
while this command is executing. Since this command may run for an
extended period of time, a mechanism has been supplied for aborting:
enter 'sy=brk fivpt &' as a SNAP command.  The program will return the
antenna to the last good offset for each axis. If there was no good
offset measurement on an axis, then the original offset is used.

In order for this command to work, the following conditions must be
met: (1) the detector device has been setup by the Field System, (2)
the appropriate lo= command has been issued, and (3) the IF
distributor or IF3 module has been setup by the Field System and is in
remote (Mark III/IV only). If a Mark III/IV video converter is used as
the detector then the appropriate patch= command must have been issued
as well.  For a VLBA/4 or DBBC rack with a BBC selected as a detector
the appropriate BBC IF input must be selected with a bbcXX=
command. If estimates of performance based on the source flux are
desired, then the appropriate fluxes must be available from the
flux,ctl file for the source being observed.well.

If the noise diode temperature is less than zero, it is assumed that
there is no noise diode to use. All power measurements will be made
assuming the absolute value of the diode temperature is the system
temperature. Thus if the noise diode temperature is -100, the (net)
antenna temperature measurements will come out as a percentage of the
system temperature. The SEFD should still be a useful measurement.

For continuous calibration for an IF detector in a DBBC rack, there
are no separate cal-on and cal-off data. In this case, the total power
detector is used with an (internally) assumed the diode temperature of
-100. As a result, the effects of the preceding paragraph apply.

For continuous calibration with a DBBC, the Tsys measurements samples
are the larger of the specified integration time and the samples
specified in cont_cal=on,... command.

If the noise diode temperature is greater than zero, then two
procedures must be available: calonfp and calofffp, which are
used by fivpt to turn the noise diode on and off respectively.
The recommended form for these procedures is:

CALONFP:  calon
          !+1s
          sy=rte_go fivpt &

CALOFFFP: caloff
          !+1s
          sy=rte_go fivpt &

calon and caloff are local procedures that do whatever is necessary to
turn the noise source on and off, respectively. Continuous cal does
not use these procedures, but it is still recommended that they be
available. This will prevent 'fivpt' from hanging if continuous cal is
accidentally not enabled.  If 'fivpt' hang does hang in this
situation, it can be restarted again with:

          sy=rte_go fivpt & 

Of course, if continuous cal is not enabled when it should be, the
data is unlikely to be useful.

For issues related to switching between continuous and non-continuous
call, please see the 'Continuous vs non-continuous cal switching
considerations' section of the 'Comments' in 'help=onoff'.

If the number of pts is negative, this will disable the initial system
temperature measuement. This may be useful for station dependent
detectors u5 and u6 if there is no way to make a "zero" measurement. A
nominal conversion factor of unity and offset of zero is assumed in
converting from detector counts to displayed antenna temperature,
i.e., measurements are reported in detector units with an assumed zero
offset.  This allows you to make pointing measurements even if you
have no way to get a "zero" signal off measurement. If the "zero"
level is actually 0, then the estimated SEFD should be accurate.

If station dependent detectors u5 or u6 are used and the number of pts
is not negative, then two procedures must be available: sigonfp and
sigofffp, which are used by fivpt to turn the signal to the station
dependent detectors on and off, respectively. The recommended form for
these procedures is:

SIGONFP:  sigon
          !+1s
          sy=rte_go fivpt &

SIGOFFFP: sigoff
          !+1s
          sy=rte_go fivpt &

sigon and sugoff are local procedures that turn the signal to
the station dependent detectors on and off, respectively.
 
There is a known bug in the use of these procedures: calonfp,
calofffp, sigonfp, and sigofffp,  that may require the last
two lines to be repeated in each procedure. In other words
after the first line each procedure should contain:

          !+1s
          sy=rte_go fivpt &
          !+1s
          sy=rte_go fivpt &

The indication that this is needed is if  fivpt seems to hang
after executing one of these procedures. Please see the "Known
Bugs" section of the latest update notice for more details.

The default wait time for of 120 seconds is generous, but can be
adjusted if necessary. Slower antennas may need a longer time. Shorter
times are only useful to make fivpt give-up sooner if there is a
problem getting on-source.
