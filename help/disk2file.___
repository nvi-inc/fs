Comments:
The dis2file command can be used to transfer some or all of a recorded
scan from a Mark 5 disk to the Mark 5 Linux file system. This transfer
can not be done while the system is recording or performing some other
type of Mark 5 data operation, such as recording. The data transfer
can not be interrupted by other data operations or configuration
changes.

The transfer takes place at approximatelty 2.2e8 to 2.8e8 baud. Linux
disk contention issues may reduce the transfer speed. The expected
transfer time can be calculated approximately as:

((seconds of data being transferred)*tracks*(track bit rate))/2.2e8

The transfer is always made using the "w" option of the Mark 5
disk2file command, which erases any pre-existing version of the same
file. See the monitor only parameter "option" for the details.

The use of "abort" as the first parameter will cause any active
transfer to be stopped. No error will be returned if there is no
transfer active or any other Mark 5 error occurs.

The start and end parameters are fully defined under the "scan_set
command at "http://web.haystack.mit.edu/mark5/command5a.pdf". For
typical use start and stop are UT epochs of the form
"####y###d##h##m##s" are used. The seconds field can include a decimal
point and fractional part. If fields are omitted the first occuring
instance in the scan that matches the specified fields is implied. As
of this writing (Nov 2004), Mark5A programs in the field will refuse
to accept times outside the actual recording available on disk. An
update is planned that will use any data within the specified start
and stop times. This will be more robust.

The "options" settable parameter is currently ignored, but is included
for future expansion.
