Settable Parameters:
          scan        Mark 5 scan label or number to transfer,
                      maximum 63 characters, blank for the most
                      recent recording, "abort" to stop current
                      transfer, scan label for monitor response
          destination Filename to store the transfer data to, maximum 128
                      characters, default uses Mark5 disk2file default. If
                      scan is "abort", this second optional parameter can
                      used to enable the "autoftp" feature. See the comments
                      section below for more details.
          start       String to be passed to Mark5 scan_set command to define
                      start of data transfer, see comments below, maximum 32
                      characters, for monitor, the start returned by scan_set?
          end         String to be passed to Mark5 scan_set command to define
                      end of data transfer, see comments below. maximum 32
                      characters, for monitor, the end returned by scan_set?
          options     Curently ignored, maximum 32 characters
          autoftp     literal string 'autoftp', if included after 'abort'
                      for scan parameter causes the 'autoftp' script to be run,
                      default is empty, therefore no running of 'autoftp', see
                      comments
          string      optional string to be passed to the 'autoftp' script, if
                      invoked, see comments

Monitor-only parameters:
          scan_number Mark5 scan number, not included for Mark5B
          m5option    Mark5 disk2file transfer option:
                        n create file; error if existing file
                        w erase existing file, if any; create new file
                        a create file if necessary, or append to existing file
          start_byte  Mark5  disk2file? start byte for transfer
          end_byte    Mark5  disk2file? end byte for transfer
          status      Mark5  disk2file? status: active or inactive
          current     current Mark5  disk2file? byte of transfer

Comments:
The dis2file command can be used to transfer some or all of a recorded
scan from a Mark 5 disk to the Mark 5 Linux file system. This transfer
can not be done while the system is recording or performing some other
type of Mark 5 data operation, such as recording. The data transfer
can not be interrupted by other data operations or configuration
changes.

The transfer takes place at approximatelty 2.2e8 to 2.8e8 baud. Linux
disk contention issues may reduce the transfer speed. The expected
transfer time can be calculated approximately as:

((seconds of data being transferred)*tracks*(track bit rate))/2.2e8

The transfer is always made using the "w" option of the Mark 5
disk2file command, which erases any pre-existing version of the same
file. See the monitor only parameter "option" for the details.

The use of "abort" as the first parameter will cause any active
transfer to be stopped. No error will be returned if there is no
transfer active or any other Mark 5 error occurs. In order to
implement automatc ftp-ing of the destination file to a correlator, an
optional second parameter "autoftp" can be included. If included, the
FS will execute a command equivalent to:

     autoftp node destination string

in a separate "xterm" named "autoftp", where "node" is the node name
or IP address specified for the Mark5 in mk5ad.ctl, "destination" is
the previously specified file name parameter in the "disk2file=..."
that caused the most recent transfer, and "string" is an optional
additional string that be specified after the "autoftp" parameter. The
"string" parameter is intended to provide control over the "autoftp"
script's behavior, if this has been implemented locally. For example,
it might be used to select which correlator the file is sent to.  If
no "destination" was explicitly established or the FS has been
restarted since then, the FS will try to determine the most recently
used file name using "disk2file?". If that also fails to produce a
file name, the FS will give up. Please see the file
/usr2/fs/msic/autoftp.txt for information on how to configure this
station customizable feature. Unless a local version has been
configured, a dummy 'stub' "autoftp" that does nothing is used.

Turning the "autoftp" feature on in a schedule requires either setting
the "AutoFTP" keyword on in the skedf.ctl control file to make it the
default behavior or using DRUDG option (15) "Data Transfer Override"
to toggle it on an experiment by experiment basis.  Note that option
15 only appears if the .skd file contains data_transfer statements.
Please see the example skedf.ctl control file,
/usr2/fs/st.default/control/skedf.ctl, for more information about the
AutoFTP keyword in skedf.ctl.

Each use of autoftp will cause the most recent disk2file destination
file to be handled even if a previous use of autoftp handled it.

The start and end parameters are fully defined under the "scan_set
command at "http://web.haystack.mit.edu/mark5/command5a.pdf".  For
typical use start and stop are UT epochs of the form
"####y###d##h##m##s" are used. The seconds field can include a decimal
point and fractional part. If fields are omitted the first occuring
instance in the scan that matches the specified fields is
implied. Using UT epoches to collect data for near-realtime fringes
tests is the most robust approach. It will allow eac station to select
the subset of data that is required irrespective of where it is
recorded on the disks. If the entire time span is not available
(because for example of observing problems), the Mark 5 will return
the subset that is.

The "options" settable parameter is currently ignored, but is included
for future expansion.
