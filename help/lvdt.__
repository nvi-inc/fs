lvdt - head position by LVDT voltage
Syntax:      lvdt=cmdVw,cmdVr
             lvdt

Response:    lvdt/cmdVw,cmdVr,actVw,actVr,deltaV
             w,deltaVr


Settable parameters:
cmdVw           command position voltage for write head, default
                is don't move
cmdVr           command position voltage for read head, default
                is don't move. This parameter is not valid for
                VLBA recorders.

Monitor-only parameters:
actVw           actual position voltage for write head
actVr           actual position voltage for read head, null for
                VLBA
deltaVw         voltage difference between actual and
                commanded write head position
deltaVr         voltage difference between actual and
                commanded read head position, null for VLBA

Comments: 
This command is used to position the narrow track head stacks in
voltage units. An individual head may be moved by not specifying
a command voltage for the other head.

VLBA recorders have only one head. Its positioning is specified
by using the first (write) head parameter. Monitor parameters for
the read head are reported as null.

The deltaVx parameters are reported with the sign of actual
minus commanded.

The command positions reported by the lvdt, pass, and stack
commands are consistent. See the description of the pass
command for more information.

If the write head position is commanded, the auxiliary data field
is set to reflect the commanded position, see the pass command
for more information. (Not yet implemented for VLBA rack.)
