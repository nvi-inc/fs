          lvdt - head stack positioning by LVDT voltage

Syntax:     lvdt=cmdVw,cmdVr

Response:   lvdt/cmdVw,cmdVr,actVw,actVr,deltaVw,deltaVr


Settable parameters:
cmdVw   Command position voltage for the write head stack,
        default is don't move. For Mark IV this parameter refers
        to head stack 1.
cmdVr   Command position voltage for read head stack, default is
        don't move. This parameter is not valid for VLBA
        recorders. For Mark IV this parameter refers to head stack 2.

Monitor-only parameters:
actVw     Actual position voltage for write head stack (Mark IV
          stack 1)
actVr     Actual position voltage for read head stack (Mark IV
          stack 2), null for VLBA
deltaVw   Voltage difference between actual and commanded write
          head stack position (Mark IV stack 1).
deltaVr   Voltage difference between actual and commanded read head
          stack position (Mark IV stack 2), null for VLBA

Comments: 
This command is used to position the head stacks in voltage units.
An individual stack may be moved by not specifying a command
voltage for the other stack. The commanded positions are
uncalibrated.

VLBA recorders have only one head stack. Its positioning is
specified by using the first (write) stack parameter. Monitor
parameters for the read head stack are reported as null.

For Mark IV recorders, the write head stack parameters correspond
to head stack 1, the read head stack parameters to head stack 2.

The deltaVx parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus
commanded.

The command positions reported by the lvdt, pass, and stack
commands are consistent. See the description of the pass command
for more information.

If the write head stack position is commanded, the auxiliary data
field is set to reflect the commanded position, see the pass
command for more information. (Not yet implemented for VLBA.)

For VLBA2 drives, the voltage units are actually in kè (0.1
microns) of head position. This implies that the scale is expanded
by a factor of about 1500 over the LVDT voltage scale of other
drives.
