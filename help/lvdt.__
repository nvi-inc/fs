lvdt - positioning by LVDT voltage
Syntax:      lvdt=cmdVw,cmdVr

Response:    lvdt/cmdVw,cmdVr,actVw,actVr,
             deltaVw,deltaVr


Settable parameters:
cmdVw          command position voltage for the write head stack, default
               is don't move. This parameter refers to Mark IV head stack
               1.
cmdVr          command position voltage for read head stack, default is
               don't move. This parameter is not valid for VLBA
               recorders. This parameter refers to Mark IV head stack 2.

Monitor-only parameters:
actVw          actual position voltage for write head stack (Mark IV stack
               1)
actVr          actual position voltage for read head stack (Mark IV stack
               2), null for VLBA
deltaVw        voltage difference between actual and commanded write head
               stack position (Mark IV stack 1).
deltaVr        voltage difference between actual and commanded read head
               stack position (Mark IV stack 2), null for VLBA

Comments: 
This command is used to position the head stacks in voltage units. An
individual stack may be moved by not specifying a command voltage for the
other stack. The commanded positions are uncalibrated.

VLBA recorders have only one head stack. Its positioning is specified by using
the first (write) stack parameter. Monitor parameters for the read head stack
are reported as null.

For Mark IV recorders, the write head stack parameters correspond to head
stack 1, the read head stack parameters to head stack 2.

The deltaVx parameters are reported with the sign of actual minus
commanded.

The command positions reported by the lvdt, pass, and stack commands
are consistent. See the description of the pass command for more
information.

If the write head stack position is commanded, the auxiliary data field is set
to reflect the commanded position, see the pass command for more
information. (Not yet implemented for VLBA.)
