sff - super fast-forward
Syntax:      sff

Response:    sff/acknowledgement


Parameters: none

Comments:
The tape is started moving forward at super high speed. For Mark III, the
record bit is disabled and the low tape sensor is turned on. For VLBA, all
track groups are disabled and the low tape sensor is turned on.

The tape is moved at the "super" speed value as specified in the equip.ctl
control file. This is the fastest speed that your tape drive can manage,
normally 330 ips.

Use the ff command and fastf procedure for positioning the tape during a
schedule.
