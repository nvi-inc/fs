PC - Send a message to the PC

Syntax:   PC=<resp mode>,<trans mode>,<message>
Response: <response>

Settable parameters:
<resp mode>: INIT = set up PC LU, set PC clock
             NRES = ignore response from PC
             RESP = read and display response from PC
<trans mode>: DIR = send message directly, as is (default)
             FRM = format MET, POINT or LOS command before sending
             Note: only "FRM" is checked for, any other characters
             are assumed to mean direct mode.
<message>: character string to be sent to PC

Monitor-only parameters:
<response>: response from PC if resp mode is RESP

      Comments: This command allows a message to be sent to a
personal computer connected to the HP1000 via a 12966A card. It
also allows responses to be received from the PC. Its purpose is
to allow the WVR TASK software, running on the PC, to be controlled
by the Field System. That is, TASK commands can be issued by the
Field System operator or by Field System procedures. Before
commands can be sent, program PCCOM must first be run with the
string RU,PCCOM,<LU>, where <LU> is the LU of the PC. This sets up
the LU and, if TASK is running in the PC, the PC clock is set to
the time on the HP clock. Issuing the command in the INITI
procedure will repeat this set up procedure.

In trans mode DIR, <message> is sent unchanged to the PC. In trans
mode FRM, which may only be used with the MET, POINT or LOS
commands of TASK, parameters are retrieved from Field System
Common, loaded into the message buffer in the proper format, and
sent to the PC. In this case, <message> should consist of only the
command name, e.g. PC=NRES,FRM,LOS.
