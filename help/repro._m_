            Response:   repro/bypass,trackA,trackB,bandwidth,equalizer


Settable parameters:

            read-after-write.
            trackA      Track for decoder channel A, default 1; 0-28
            allowed.
            trackB      Track for decoder channel B, default 1; 0-28
            allowed.
          bandwidth Bandwidth for decoding , MHz, default 2; 0.0625,
          0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 MHz allowed or actual
          tape speed 4.21875, 8.4375, 16.875, 33.75, 67.5,
          135, and 270 ips allowed
            equalizer   Equalizer for reproduce, MHz, defaults to bandwidth;
            0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 MHz allowed or
            actual tape speed 4.21875, 8.4375, 16.875, 33.75,
            67.5, 135, and 270 ips allowed 

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 
MAT module functions available for Mark III.

The raw mode normally is used only when checking parity errors
on the tape.

Selection of track 0 for a decoder channel will disable that
channel until another track is selected.

Note that a VLBA or Mark IV track number equals the Mark III
track number plus three. Consequently, odd Mark III tracks are
even VLBA or Mark IV track numbers and vice-versa. See the
Track Assignment Tables in the System Set-up manual. Also VLBA
group numbers equal Mark III group numbers minus one, but the
VLBA groups include additional tracks. Note that this command
uses Mark III track numbers.
