         bit_density - recording bit density (VLBA drive)

Syntax:     bit_density=bpi

Response:   bit_density/bpi


Settable parameters:
bpi       Bit density in bits per inch.

Monitor-only parameters: none

Comments: 

This command specifies the total bit density including all header
and parity bits. The specified bit density and the formatter set-up
determine the default speed for the st command.

The bit density can be set to any positive value less than 232.
Useful values are 33333 for Mark III data-replacement format and
34020 for the VLBA non-data-replacement format.

When calculating speeds from bit densities it is useful to remember
that for a nominal per track bit data rate of  4 MBit/sec, the
Mark III data-replacement format actually generates 4.5 MBit/sec
and the VLBA non-data-replacement format generates 4.536 MBit/sec.
