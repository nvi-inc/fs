Comments:

This command sends low-level communication messages to a Core3H board
and presents the response. The response may span multiple lines
corresponding to the lines sent by the Core3H board. All lines except
the final one will be labeled with #dbbcn#. The final response line
will be the FiLa10G (which is what the Core3H board returns) prompt
unless the output exceeds the internal buffer limits of the FS
(currently 1024 characters). In the latter case, as much data as will
fit will be presented and an error reported.

Communication with the Core3H board is accomplished through the DBBC3.
However, the user should not put "core3h=n," at the start of the
*data_to* field as the command will do this automatically.

The core3h command cannot be used if the rack type in equip.ctl
specifies a DBBC2. Other rack types do not limit the use of this
command.
