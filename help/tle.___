Settable parameters:
        line    Which line is being defined. No default.
        catnum  Catalog number of the satellite
        string  Variable meaning string, see name, tle_1, and
                tle_2 under Monitor-only parameters.

Monitor-only parameters:
        name    Satellite common name, maximum 24 characters
        tle_1   TLE line 1, maximum 69 characters
        tle_2   TLE line 2, maximum 69 characters


Comments: 
This command is used to input a TLE for use with the "satellite"
command.

For tle_1 and tle_2 three checks are made: (1) the line starts with
the right character, '1' or '2', respectively, (2) the internal
catalog number agrees with catnum, and (3) the check-sum is correct.
