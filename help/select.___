 Comments:
 This command is used to select which recorder is active in a
 two recorder system. Most commands that refer to a recorder
 explicitly refer to the recorder in the command name, but some
 commands that refer primarily to the rack need to know
 implicit which recorder is in use. These commands depend on
 this command to specify which drive is in use. In particular
 the pass command needs to know which head position to encode
 in the AUX data field and the VLBA form command needs to know
 which recorder to use for DQA input. In addition, the chekr
 and monit programs need to know which recorder is in use to
 check and display the status of.
