                  tpdiff - TPICAL-TPI difference

            Syntax:     tpdiff=list

            Response:   tpdiff/differences


Settable parameters:
            list        List of total power integrators to read back.
            Standard detector mnemonics allowed.  In addition for VLBA/4/5
            formif and formbbc are permitted, for Mark III/IV/5,
            formif and formvc are permitted.

Monitor-only parameters:
            differences List of readings, counts. These values are stored
            for use by the tsys/5/6 commands.

Comments:
Except for station defined detectors, the results are returned
grouped in pairs of detector mnemonic,value, the output is
collected into lines by IF channel. Detectors that have no IF
assigned are displayed first followed by  IFs 1-3 (Mark III/IV
or LBA4), 1-4 (LBA) and a-d (VLBA/4). If the output for an IF
would make a long output line, the output is split into more
than one line. For station defined detectors the results are
just displayed in order: u5, u6.

A time-out or other error on one more devices for a Mark
III/IV, LBA, or VLBA/VLBA4 detector will not prevent results
from other detectors from being displayed.  A negative integer
will be shown for each channel that had an error that
prevented an actual measurement from being displayed. An
overflow value, 65535, is displayed as dollar signs, $$$$$.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the
VCs are displayed as hs, where h is the VC number as hex and s
is for the detector is use: d (dual for upper/lower), u
(upper), l (lower), a digit 3-7 for other detectors or 'x' for
unknown.

For VLBA/4/5, additional mnemonics formif and formbbcc are permitted
in the list.  These select the detectors for the IF channels and BBC
sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter.  For Mark
III/IV/5, formvc is accepted instead of formbbc, as well as formif.

This command forms the difference between tpical and tpi
measurements for use in the tsys/5/6 command.
