                  tpdiff - TPICAL-TPI difference

            Syntax:     tpdiff=list

            Response:   tpdiff/differences


Settable parameters:

            list         List of total power integrators to form
                         differences for.  Standard detector mnemonics
                         allowed.  In addition: for VLBA/4/5/DBBC
                         'formif' and 'formbbc' are permitted; for
                         Mark III/IV/5, 'formif' and 'formvc' are
                         permitted; station detectors 'u5' and 'u6'
                         are permitted.


Monitor-only parameters:

            differences  List of detector & difference pairs.
                         Differences are in counts.  These values are
                         stored for use by the 'tpdiff' and 'tsys'
                         commands.

Comments:

The results are returned grouped in pairs of 'mnemonic,value' per
detector.  The output is collected into lines by IF channel.
Detectors that have no IF assigned are displayed first followed by
those for IFs '1'-'3' (Mark III/IV) or 'a'-'d' (VLBA/4/5/DBBC).  If
the output for an IF would make a long output line, the output is
split into more than one line.  For station detectors, the values are
displayed on one line.

For Mark III/IV and LBA4 racks the detector mnemonics for the VCs are
displayed as 'hs', where 'h' is the VC number as hex and 's' is for
the sideband: 'd' (dual for upper/lower), 'u' (upper), 'l' (lower), a
digit '3'-'7' for other VC detectors or 'x' for unknown.

For VLBA/4/5/DBBC, additional mnemonics 'formif' and 'formbbc' are
permitted in the 'list'.  These select the detectors for the IF channels
and BBC sidebands currently being recorded by the formatter.  For Mark
III/IV/5, 'formvc' is accepted instead of 'formbbc', as well as
'formif'.

A time-out or other error on one more devices on the proceeding
'tpical' or 'tpi' commands for will not prevent results from other
detectors from being displayed.  A negative integer will be shown for
each channel that had an error that prevented an actual value from
being reported.

This command forms the difference between 'tpical' and 'tpi'
measurements, which must have been previously recorded, for use in the
'tsys' command.
