mk5b_mode/bit_streams/mk5c_mode - set mk5b recording mode

syntax:   mk5b_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp,okay
        bit_streams=source,mask,decimation,sample
          mk5c_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample,okay

Response:   mk5b_mode/source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp
          bit_streams/source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp
            mk5c_mode/source,mask,decimation,sample,format,tracks,tbitrate,frame

Settable parameters:
source:     data source: ext, tvg, ramp, or vdif. Default: ext.
            On display may be the "magic" recording mode specifier used
            by jive5ab. 
mask:       bit-stream mask, hex, non-zero 32-bit wide maximum,
            for example: 0xf, default 0xffffffff.
decimation: decimation factor: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. No default unless sample
            (next parameter) is specified.
sample:     sample rate: must be greater than 0.124.  The value divided 
            into the Mark 5B clock rate (from equip.ctl) must yield a valid
            decimation factor.  Default is the clock rate from equip.ctl
            (decimation becomes "1") unless the specified rate is "none",
            in which case this command will report an error.
fpdp:       fpdp mode: 1 or 2. Default: no command sent to Mark 5B
okay        overide to allow command while recording, literal ascii:
            disk_record_ok

Monitor only parameter:
format      VDIF or possibly others (see jive5ab mode? query response)
tracks      number of tracks
tbitrate    total bit rate (Mbps)
frame       frame size in bytes

Comments:
"bit_streams" is an alias for the "mk5b_mode" and "mk5c_mode" commands
that does not communicate with the recorder.  All other aspects of its
operation are identical for the first four parameters.  The main
purpose of "bit_streams" is to provide a way to set the bitstream mask
for correct sampling of Tsys when no recorder is being used (typically
during eVLBI) when a Mark 5B/C compatible rack, such as a Mark 5,
VLBA5, DBBC, or DDBC/FiLA10G (or none) is in use.  For such racks, if
the recorder is set to "none" in DRUDG, the "bit_stream" command will be
generated instead of mk5b_mode.

"mk5c_mode" is an alias for the "mk5b_mode" command, but is used with
Mark 5C recorders only.  The recorder must be controlled by the
"jive5ab" control program for this command to work.  When the
"mk5c_mode=..."  command is used, a "clock_set" command specifying the
actual sample rate of the data is sent to the recorder.  The
decimation factor, regardless of the SNAP command value specified,
sent to the recorder is always "1" for the Mark 5C since there is no
decimation.  The sample rate can be specified in the SNAP command
either explicitly with the "sample" parameter or implicitly with the
"decimate" parameter.  In the latter case, the actual sample rate (of
the recorded data) is calculated using the Mark 5B clock rate
specified in "equip.ctl".  If the specified clock rate is "none", the
"clock_set" command is suppressed.  The use of "clock_set" is
necessary for the "bank_check" SNAP command (which uses the low-level
Mark 5 command "rtime?") to work for for Mark 5C.

In query response for these commands, if the sample rate is not known
and the bitrate is not available, the commanded sample rate is shown
in parentheses for informational purposes.

For "mk5c_mode", a query of the FS's model of the state of the device
("mk5c_mode=?") prints the sample rate as zero and the decimation that
is implied by the commanded sample rate given the defined Mark 5B
clock rate, even though the decimation is actually "1" and the clock
rate commanded to the recorder is actually the requested sample rate.
For VDIF format the mask, decimation, and sample are not returned by
the Mark 5C.

Bitmask LSB is VSI bit-stream 0, e.g. 0x1 selects bit-stream 0, etc.
The number of bits turned on in the bit-stream mask must be 2^n where
0 <= n <= 5, or the Mark5B will reject the command with an error.

Only one of "decimation" and "sample" may be specified.

Non-default values of "fpdp" are for diagnostic use only.  The default
is that the parameter is not sent to the recorder which causes the
device to use its own default, which is different for 5B and 5B+.
Value 2 is not supported by Mark 5B recorders, but is by Mark 5B+
recorders.

The "mk5b_mode=" and "mk5c_mode=" command will not succeed if
recording has been commanded with the "disk_record=on" command.
Either recording must be stopped using "disk_record=off" command first
or if you wish to continue to set the mode despite recording being
recording being active (not recommended), you can use "disk_record_ok"
as the sixth parameter of the command as an override.  If "jive5ab" is
being used to run the recorder and the override is used while
recording is active, the command will cause an error response from the
recorder and not be effective.  Changing the mode while recording will
probably cause problems with the recording and is not recommended.
