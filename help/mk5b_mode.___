mk5b_mode/bit_streams/mk5c_mode - set mk5b/Ethernet recording mode

syntax:   mk5b_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp,okay
        bit_streams=source,mask,decimation,sample
          mk5c_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample

Response:   mk5b_mode/source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp
          bit_streams/source,mask,decimation,sample
            mk5c_mode/source,mask,decimation,sample,format,tracks,bitrate,frame

source:     data source or format
            For mk5b_mode: ext, tvg, or ramp; default: ext.
            For mk5c_mode: vdif or  mark5b; default: vdif.
	    Ignored for bit_streams.

            For mark5c_mode, the monitor value is the "magic"
            recording mode specifier used by "jive5ab".

            See the comments for information on using "mark5b" for
            Mark5B-over-Ethernet, which is not fully supported by the
            FS.

mask:       bit-stream mask, hex, non-zero 64-bit wide maximum,
            default 0xffffffff (least 32 bits on).
            There is no monitor value for Ethernet recorders.

decimation: decimation factor
	    For mk5b_mode: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16.  No default unless
            sample (next parameter) is specified.
            For mk5c_mode: only available for source "mark5b".
            There is no monitor value for Ethernet recorders.
	    Ignored for bit_streams.

            For mk5b_mode, and mk5c_mode with 5b/Ethernet, the minimum
            implied sample rate (relative to the VSI-H/Mark5B clock
            rate in equip.ctl) is 2 Mbps.

sample:     sample rate: in MHz.  For mk5b_mode: the possible range of
            values includes 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64, but the range is
            more limited due to the available decimation factors; see
            comments; default sample rate is the VSI-H/Mark5B clock
            rate (from equip.ctl) unless a decimation factor was
            specified or the VSI-H/Mark5B clock rate is "none".  For
            mk5c_mode, the value when considered with the track mask
            must yield a multiple of 1 Mbps for the total rate; see
            comments; no default.  Ignored for bit_streams.

fpdp:       fpdp mode: 1 or 2. Default: no command sent to recorder.
	    Ignored for mk5c_mode and bit_streams.

okay        overide to allow command while recording, literal ascii:
            disk_record_ok
	    Ignored for mk5c_mode and bit_streams.

Monitor only parameter:
format      VDIF or possibly others (see "jive5ab" mode? query response)
tracks      number of tracks, Ethernet recorders only
bitrate     track bit rate (Mbps), Ethernet recorders only
frame       VDIF frame size in bytes, VDIF format only

Comments:
The effective sample rate can be specified in the SNAP command either
explicitly with the "sample" parameter or implicitly with the
"decimate" parameter.  Only one of "decimation" and "sample" may be
specified.  For VDIF, "decimation" cannot be specified.  The recorders
do not respond with the effective sample rate.  In the query response
for these commands, the commanded sample rate, if it was explicitly
commanded, is shown in parentheses for informational purposes only.

The "mk5c_mode" command is an alias for the "mk5b_mode" command, but
is used with Mark 5C/FlexBuff recorders only and with slightly
different parameters.  The recorder must be controlled by the
"jive5ab" control program for this command to work.

For the "mk5b_mode=..." and "mk5c_mode=mark5b,...", the minimum sample
rate is 2 Mbps.  As a result the decimation factor may not yield an
effective sample rate less than 2 Mbps when divided into the
VSI-H/Mark5B clock rate (from equip.ctl).  When specifying the
decimation implicitly via a sample rate, the range of available sample
rates is similarly limited by the range of decimation factors
available.  As a result, the sample rate must be one of the powers of
2 (MHz) starting with the VSI-H/Mark5B clock rate divided by 16 up to
the VSI-H/Mark5B clock rate itself.

For Ethernet recording, either VDIF (via "mk5c_mode=vdif,...") or
5b-over-Ethernet (via "mk5c_mode=mark5b,..."), the limitations on
sample rates are described in next paragraph.

The sample rate parameter is in units of MHz.  More resolution, down
to 1 Hz, can obtained for Ethernet recorders by appending a decimal
point and trailing digits. e.g. a sample rate of 15625 Hz (the lowest
possible with a 64-bit mask) can be specified as "0.015625".  In
principle the maximum value of the sample rate is the maximum value
that will fit in an unsigned 64-bit integer, or 18446744073709551615
Hz.  However, the possible values are futher limited by the fact that
the total date rate must fit in a unsigned 64-bit value and be a
multiple of 1 Mbps (for "mk5c_mode=...") , i.e., 18446744073709 Mbps
is the maximum.  Therefore the maximum effective sample rate is
18446744073709. MHz (using only one track).  No limit checking is
performed, so values that exceed these limits may produce erroneous
results with no warning.  However, any unallowed values below these
limits will return an error.

For Ethernet recording, the "mk5c_mode=..." command in addition to
defining the mode, also sends a "net_protocol=..." command.  For Mark
5C, it also sends "packet=..." command.  For FlexBuff, it also sends
an "mtu=..." command.  The operator can manually include
"net_port=..."  commands if they are needed.

The "bit_streams" commands is an alias for the "mk5b_mode" and
"mk5c_mode" commands that does not communicate with the recorder.  All
parameters except the bit mask are ignored.  The main purpose of
"bit_streams" is to provide a way to set the bit stream mask for
correct sampling of Tsys when no recorder is being used (typically
during eVLBI) when a rack compatible with a Mark 5B/5C/FlexBuff (or
none) recorder is in use.

To get Tsys data for eVLBI, the user, in DRUDG, should select "none"
for the recorder and the appropriate *non-FiLa10G* rack type.  Since
there is no recorder, DRUDG will use the "bit_streams=..." command.
This will set the bit mask in place of the "mk5b_mode=..." or
"mk5c_mode=..." command.  If a non-FiLa10G rack is specified, DRUDG
will also not use the "filag_mode=..."  command.  The result of having
no "mk5b_mode=..."/"mk5c_mode=..." and "fila10g_mode=..." commands is
that the FS will not interfere with eVLBI remote control of the Mark
5B/5C/FlexBuff and or a "FiLa10G".  The FS should still have the
correct rack and recorder selected in equip.ctl.

The recorder bit mask, only, determines the Tsys data reporting.  When
a FiLa10G is in use, DRUDG always uses equivalent bit masks for
"fila10g_mode=..." and "mk5c_mode=..." commands, but the FiLa10G mask
has no effect on the Tsys data reported

When an Ethernet recorder is in use, the mask, decimation, and sample
values are not returned by "jive5ab".

Bitmask LSB is VSI bit-stream 0, e.g. 0x1 selects bit-stream 0, etc.
The number of bits turned on in the bit-stream mask must be 2^n where
0 <= n <= 5, or a Mark5B will reject the command with an error.

Non-default values of "fpdp" are for diagnostic use only.  The default
is that the parameter is not sent to the recorder which causes the
device to use its own default, which is different for 5B and 5B+.
Value 2 is not supported by Mark 5B recorders, but is by Mark 5B+
recorders.

The "mk5b_mode=" and "mk5c_mode=" command will not succeed if
recording has been commanded with the "disk_record=on" command.
Either recording must be stopped using "disk_record=off" command first
or (only for Mark 5B recorders controlled by "DIMino") if you wish to
continue to set the mode despite recording being recording being
active (not recommended), you can use "disk_record_ok" as the sixth
parameter of the "mk5b_mode=..." command as an override.  If "jive5ab"
is being used to run the Mark 5B recorder and the override is used
while recording is active, the command will cause an error response
from the recorder and will not be effective.  The override is not
available for "mk5c_mode=...".  Changing the mode while recording will
probably cause problems with the recording and is not recommended.

Notes on Mark5B-over-Ethernet (5B/Ethernet): Only VDIF recording is
  recommended for use with the Ethernet recorders.  5B/Ethernet is not
  fully supported by the FS.  However, there is a path to recording it
  if it is needed in an unusual situation.  Please follow these steps:

     1. DRUDG the experiment observing schedule normally.

     2. Use PFMED to edit all the setup procedures in the experiment
        .prc file. In each:

        a. Change the "vdif" parameter in the "mk5c_mode=vdif,..."
           command to "mark5b".

        b. Insert the command "fila10g=start mk5b" immediately after
           the "fila10g_mode=..." command.
   
     3. Run the experiment with these changes.

   One reason that 5B/Ethernet is not recommended is that it is more
   difficult to maintain data integrity than for VDIF.  If you have
   too much data loss with 5B/Ethernet, there may be ways to improve
   the situation if you are sending the data with a FiLa10G.  Making
   sure the fibers are clean and using a direct connection (i.e. no
   intermediary devices) between the FiLa10G and recorder can improve
   the results; both of these suggestions can help for VDIF as well as
   5B/Ethernet and for data sources other than a FiLa10G.  In addition
   for a FlexBuff recorder the following item may help:

     For a FlexBuff recorder, you can recompile "jive5ab" with the
     "FILA=1" make option.  If this option was used, it will be
     visible in the "version?"  query response from "jive5ab".  This
     will change "jive5ab" to use the FiLa10G style Mark 5B packet
     sequence numbers.  **The resulting executable should not be used
     for VDIF recording**.  Please see the installation instructions
     in the "jive5ab" source distribution for more information or
     contact Harro Verkouter (verkouter@jive.eu) for additional
     assistance.

     Please note that for Mark 5C recorders, the "FILA=1" option will
     not improve the situation.
