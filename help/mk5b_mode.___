mk5b_mode/bit_streams/mk5c_mode - set mk5b recording mode

syntax:   mk5b_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp,okay
        bit_streams=source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp,okay
      :   mk5c_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp,okay
Response:   mk5b_mode/source,mask,decimation,(sample),fpdp
          bit_streams/source,mask,decimation,(sample),fpdp
            mk5c_mode/source,mask,decimation,sample

Settable parameters:
source:     data source: ext, tvg, or ramp. Default: ext.
mask:       bit-stream mask, hex, for example: 0xf, default 0xffffffff.
decimation: decimation factor: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. No default unless sample
            (next parameter) is specified.
sample:     sample rate: must be greater than 0.124.  The value divided 
            into the Mark 5B clock rate (from equip.ctl) must yield a valid
            decimation factor.  Default is the clock rate from equip.ctl
            (decimation becomes "1") unless the specified rate is "none",
            in which case this command will report an error.
fpdp:       fpdp mode: 1 or 2. Default: no command sent to Mark 5B
okay        literal ascii: disk_record_ok

Monitor only parameter: None

Comments:

"bit_streams" is an alias for the" mk5b_mode" command that does not
communicate with the Mark 5B recorder.  All other aspects of its
operation are identical to the mk5b_mode command.  The main purpose of
"bit_streams" is to provide a way to set the bitstream mask for
correct sampling of Tsys when no recorder is being is used (typically
during eVLBI) when a Mark 5B compatible rack, such as a Mark 5, VLBA5,
or DBBC (or none) is in use.  For such racks, if the recorder is set
"none" in DRUDG, the "bit_stream" command will be generated instead of
mk5b_mode.

"mk5c_mode" is an alias for "mk5b_mode", but is used with Mark 5C
recorders only.  The recorder must be controlled by the 'jive5ab"
control program for this command to work.  When the "mk5c_mode=..."
command is used, a "clock_set" command specifying the actual sample
rate of the data is sent to the recorder.  The decimation factor,
regardless of the SNAP command value specified, sent to the recorder
is always "1" for the Mark 5C since there is no decimation.  The
sample rate can be specified in the SNAP command either explicitly
with the "sample" parameter or implicitly with the "decimate"
parameter.  In the latter case, the actual sample rate (of the
recorded data) is calculated using the Mark 5B clock rate specified in
"equip.ctl".  If the specified clock rate is "none", the clock_set
command is suppressed.  The use of "clock_set" is necessary for the
"bank_check" SNAP (which uses the low-level Mark 5 command "rtime?")
command to work for Mark 5C and is not supported for Mark 5B.

Except for "mk5c_mode", the query output includes the expected sample
rate in parentheses for information purposes only since the actual
clock rate is not read back from the recorder to determine the actual
effective sample rate in use.

For "mk5c_mode", a query of the FS's model of the state of the device
("mk5c_mode=?") prints the sample rate as zero and decimation that is
implied by the commanded sample rate given the defined Mark 5B clock
rate, even though the decimation is actually "1" and the clock rate
commanded to the recorder is actually the requested sample rate.

Mask LSB is VSI bit-stream 0, e.g. 0x1 selects bit-stream 0,
etc. The number of bits turned on in the bit-stream mask must be 2^n
where 0 <= n <= 5, or the Mark5B will reject the command with an
error.

Only one of "decimation" and "sample" may be specified.

Non-default values of "fpdp" are for diagnostic use only. The default
is that the parameter is not sent to the recorder which causes the
device to use its own default, which is different for 5B and
5B+. Value 2 is not supported by Mark 5B recorders, but is by Mark
5B+ recorders..

The "mk5b_mode=" and "mk5c_mode=" command will not succeed if
recording has been commanded with the "disk_record=on" command.
Either recording must be stopped using "disk_record=off" command first
or if you wish to continue set the mode despite recording being
active, you can use "disk_record_ok" as the sixth parameter of the
command.  Changing the mode while recording will probably cause
problems with the recording and is not recommended.
