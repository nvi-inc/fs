mk5b_mode/bit_streams/mk5c_mode - set mk5b recording mode

syntax:   mk5b_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp,okay
        bit_streams=source,mask,decimation,sample
          mk5c_mode=source,mask,decimation,sample,okay

Response:   mk5b_mode/source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp
          bit_streams/source,mask,decimation,sample,fpdp
            mk5c_mode/source,mask,decimation,sample,,format,tracks,tbitrate,frame

Settable parameters:
source:     data source: ext, tvg, ramp, or vdif. Default: ext.
            On display may be the "magic" recording mode specifier used
            by jive5ab. 
mask:       bit-stream mask, hex, non-zero 64-bit wide maximum,
            for example: 0xf, default 0xffffffff (least 32 bits on).
decimation: decimation factor: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. No default unless sample
            (next parameter) is specified.
sample:     sample rate: must be greater than 0.124.  The value divided 
            into the Mark 5B clock rate (from equip.ctl) must yield a valid
            decimation factor.  Default is the clock rate from equip.ctl
            (decimation becomes "1") unless the specified rate is "none",
            in which case this command will report an error.
fpdp:       fpdp mode: 1 or 2. Default: no command sent to recorder
okay        overide to allow command while recording, literal ascii:
            disk_record_ok

Monitor only parameter:
format      VDIF or possibly others (see jive5ab mode? query response)
tracks      number of tracks
tbitrate    total bit rate (Mbps)
frame       frame size in bytes

Comments:

The "mk5c_mode" command is an alias for the "mk5b_mode" command, but
is used with Mark 5C/FlexBuff recorders only.  The recorder must be
controlled by the "jive5ab" control program for this command to work.
When the "mk5b_mode=..." or "mk5c_mode=..."  command is used for
non-VDIF recording, a "clock_set" command specifying the actual sample
rate of the data is sent to the recorder.  The decimation factor,
regardless of the SNAP command value specified, sent to the recorder
is always "1" for the Mark 5C/FlexBuff since there is no decimation.
The sample rate can be specified in the SNAP command either explicitly
with the "sample" parameter or implicitly with the "decimate"
parameter.  In the latter case, the actual sample rate (of the
recorded data) is calculated using the Mark 5B clock rate specified in
"equip.ctl".  If the specified clock rate is "none", the "clock_set"
command is suppressed.  The use of "clock_set" is necessary for the
"bank_check" SNAP command (which uses the low-level Mark 5 command
"rtime?") to work for Mark 5C.  For VDIF recording the "mk5c_mode"
command also sends the "packet" command; for FlexBuff, it also set the
"mtu" and "net_protocol" commands.

The "bit_streams" is an alias for the "mk5b_mode" and "mk5c_mode"
commands that does not communicate with the recorder.  All other
aspects of its operation are identical for the first four parameters.
The main purpose of "bit_streams" is to provide a way to set the bit
stream mask for correct sampling of Tsys when no recorder is being
used (typically during eVLBI) when a Mark 5B/C/Flexbuff compatible
rack, such as a Mark 5, VLBA5, DBBC_DDC, DDBC_DDC/FiLA10G, DBBC_PFB,
or DBBC_PFB/FiLa10G (or none) is in use.

To get correct Tsys data for eVLBI with a DBBC, the user, in DRUDG,
should select "none" for the recorder and the approrpiate non-FiLa10G
rack type.  Since there is no recorder, DRUDG will use the bit_streams
command.  This will set the bit mask in place of the mk5b_mode or
mk5c_mode command.  The absence of the mk5b_mode command and the
fila10g_mode commands means that the FS will not interfere with eVLBI
remote control of the 5B or FiLa10G.  For the FiLa10G, getting the
correct bit mask for recording tsys data depends on the fact that
DRUDG always use equivalent bit masks for fila10g and mk5c_mode (or
bit_streams) commands.

In query response for these commands, if the sample rate is not known
and the bitrate is not available, the commanded sample rate is shown
in parentheses for informational purposes.

For "mk5c_mode", a query of the FS's model of the state of the device
("mk5c_mode=?") prints the sample rate as zero and the decimation that
is implied by the commanded sample rate given the defined Mark 5B
clock rate, even though the decimation is actually "1" and the clock
rate commanded to the recorder is actually the requested sample rate.
For VDIF format the mask, decimation, and sample are not returned by
the jive5ab.

Bitmask LSB is VSI bit-stream 0, e.g. 0x1 selects bit-stream 0, etc.
The number of bits turned on in the bit-stream mask must be 2^n where
0 <= n <= 5, or the Mark5B will reject the command with an error.

Only one of "decimation" and "sample" may be specified.

Non-default values of "fpdp" are for diagnostic use only.  The default
is that the parameter is not sent to the recorder which causes the
device to use its own default, which is different for 5B and 5B+.
Value 2 is not supported by Mark 5B recorders, but is by Mark 5B+
recorders.

The "mk5b_mode=" and "mk5c_mode=" command will not succeed if
recording has been commanded with the "disk_record=on" command.
Either recording must be stopped using "disk_record=off" command first
or if you wish to continue to set the mode despite recording being
recording being active (not recommended), you can use "disk_record_ok"
as the sixth parameter of the command as an override for Mark 5B
recorders controllled with DIMino.  If "jive5ab" is being used to run
the recorder and the override is used while recording is active, the
command will cause an error response from the recorder and not be
effective.  Changing the mode while recording will probably cause
problems with the recording and is not recommended.
