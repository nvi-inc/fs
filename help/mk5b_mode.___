mk5b_mode - set mk5b recording mode

syntax: mk5b_mode=source,mask,decimation,fpdp,okay
Response: mk5b_mode/source,mask,decimation,fpdp
Settable parameters:

source:     data source: ext, tvg, or ramp. Default: ext.
mask:       bit-stream mask, hex, for example: 0xf, default 0xffffffff.
decimation: decimation ratio: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. Default: 1.
fpdp:       fpdp mode: 1 or 2. Default: no command sent to Mark 5B
okay        literal ascii: disk_record_ok

Monitor only parameter: None

Comments: mask LSB is VSI bit-stream 0, e.g. 0x1 selects bit-stream 0,
etc. The number of bits turned on in the bit-stream mask must be 2^n
where 0 <= n <= 5, or the Mark5B will reject the command with an
error.

Non-default values of fpdp are for diagnostic use only. The default is
that the parameter is not sent to the recorder which causes the device
to use its own default, which is different for 5B and 5B+. Value 2 is
not available for Mark 5B, but is for Mark 5B+.

The mk5b_mode command will not succeed if recording has been commanded
with the disk_record=on command.  Either recording must be stopped
using disk_record=off first or if you wish to continue set the mode
despite recording being active, you can use "disk_record_ok" as the
fifth parameter of the command.  Changing the mode while recording
will probably cause problems with the recording and is not
recommended.
