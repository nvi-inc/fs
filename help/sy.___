Comments: 

This command is used to execute a UNIX program from within the Field
System.  The UNIX program is executed by using the system() call,
which executes 'command' by calling

    /bin/sh -c command

See 'man system' for more details.  Any response or error from the
command will be displayed on the terminal that the FS run on, usually
the Field System Log and Display widow, the response will not go in
the log.

Normally if you need to execute a UNIX program, use the operator menu
to open a new window temporarily and type your commands and see the
output there.  The 'sy=...' command should be used only if there is a
need for a system command in a procedure or schedule.

Any valid '/bin/sh' command that does not require input may be used.
There is no facility for accepting user input when you use the
'sy=...'  command.

Since a UNIX program could take some time to execute and therefore tie
up the Field System, it is recommended that the commands used with
'sy=...' be executed in the background by appending an '&' to the
line.  If you do want to wait until the command finishes, do not use
the '&'.  That may be necesary if some action needs to be completed
before schedule execution can continue.  However, if the command
blocks for an extended period of time, the schedule may be delayed.

Output from the command can be included in the log by using the FS
utility program, 'popen' (pronounced "p-open"), which uses the popen()
system call, in the 'sy=...' command.  For example:

  sy=popen 'ls -l' -n ls &

In this case, the 'popen' program executes the 'ls' command with
argument '-l' in background (due to the '&'), reads the command's
_stdout_ output, and logs it in the FS log.  Quotes around the command
to be executed and its arguments are required unless there are no
interior spaces (i.e., there is a single token).  The '-n ls' is an
optional argument to 'popen' and causes the log entries to have 'ls/'
prepended.  This 'name' string is also used in any error messages from
the 'popen' program itself.  In this example, an 'ls:' would be
prepended to an error message.  This 'name' option can be used to give
some identification to the log entries which be may useful to figure
out what command the entries came from.  If the '-n' option is omitted
'popen' is used as the name for prepending.  If an optional '-l' is
used as an argument for the popen progam, the result is logged only,
and not displayed to the operator.  See 'man popen' for more details
on the popen() call.
