 Comments: 
 
 This command is used to execute UNIX systems from within the
 Field System. The UNIX command is executed under your default
 shell. Any response or error from the command will be
 displayed in the Field System Log and Display widow, the
 response will not go in the log.
 
 Normally, if you need to execute a UNIX command, use the
 operator menu to open a new window temporarily and type your
 commands and see the output there. The sy command should be
 used only if there is a need for a system command in a
 procedure or schedule.
 
 Any valid UNIX command that does not require input may be
 used. There is no facility for accepting user input when you
 use the sy command.
 
 Since commands could take some time to execute and therefore
 tie up the Field System, it is recommended that commands used
 with sy be executed in the background. To have a command run
 in background and not wait for its completion, append an & to
 the command. If you do want to wait until the command
 finishes, do not use the &.
