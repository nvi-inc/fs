Comments:
This command may be given only with either one parameter on to
start recording or with no parameter to monitor whether
recording is on or off. To stop recording use the disc_end
SNAP command.

Normally scan_name is taken by default as the scan name
defined by the most recent scan_name=... command. The
scan_name parameter allows the value used for this recording
to over-riddden. It does not change the actual scan name. The
scan is sent to the Mark 5 to identify the scan being
recorded.
