            Syntax:     last_check

            Response:   last_check/check,params


Settable parameters: None

Monitor-only parameters:
            check       last check type: data_check or scan_check
            params      parameters from the last "check"

Comments:
This command provides a way to easily display the results of the last
performed check of the Mark5 recordings, either scan_check or
data_check. The most recent output parameters from the last performed
check are displayed as well as the (top level) error, if any,
generated by the same commmand. If there were no output parmeters from
the command (probably because of an error), then "params" are null. If
no check has been performed since the last computer boot, there is no
output at all.

See the help pages for "scan_check" and "data_check" for information
on their response parameters.
