LOCATE - Locate narrow-track head position

Syntax:   LOCATE=<range>,<nsamples>,<step>,<head>
          LOCATE
Response: LOCATE/<range>,<nsamples>,<step>,<head>,<peakv>,<mper>,<vltlc>

Settable parameters:
<range>:  +/- range to search over in microns. Default is 200.
<nsamples>: Number of power samples for each measurement position.
            Default is 1.
<step>: Micron step size between measurement positions. Default is 40.
<head>: Head to move: READ or WRITE, Default is READ. Only the first
        character is checked.

Monitor-only parameters:
<peakv>: peak measured voltage from power detector
<mper>: minimum sample voltage as a percentage of <peakv>
<vltlc>: location of the peak in positioner voltage

Comments: This command performs a coarse grid search for the largest
detected power over the search range.  The search is performed over a
range of +/- <range> microns about the initial head position.
The number of positions sampled is ((2*<range>)/<step>)+1.

The actual positions at which measurements are made are not exactly <step>
microns part. The head will be positioned within +/- 5 microns of the nominal
positions. This approximation is used to reduce the time moving the heads
by not over-refining the positions of what is a coarse search anyway. In the
worst (too coarse) case two positions might be <step>+10 microns apart.

After sampling over the complete range, LOCATE returns the head to the
position that gave the highest power level, makes a new measurement and
reports these values for the <peakv>, <mper>, and <vltlc> parameters.

This command requires that the reproduce power detector be hooked-up with 
a reasonable amount of attenuation and that the HEAD.CTL configuration
file correctly identify which detector (odd or even) is in use.

This command must be issued once with parameters to set it up. Issuing the
command subsequently without parameters will start a search. The tape 
must moving and there must be recorded data to reproduce for this command
to do something useful.
