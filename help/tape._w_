          vacuum,chassis,err


Settable Parameters:

            off. Normally this sensor is always left on.

          footage counter to footage.

Monitor-only Parameters:
footage   Current tape footage counter, 5 digits with leading
          zeroes. Use the rec command to move the tape to a
          desired footage or to determine the footage.
lowsense    low indicates tape is at the low tape point, otherwise
            off.

          drives.
vacuum    Tape vacuum, inches of water.
chassis   Chassis serial number.

          flag bits represent certain error conditions. Refer to
          MCB protocol, word 74 for recorder.

Comments:
This command is analagous to the Mark III tape command. The
footage count as recorded in the log file will be found in the
same location for both Mark III and VLBA systems.

If the drive type specified in the equip.ctl control file is
vlba2, the footage parameter is not supported and the vacuum
parameter is reported as null.
