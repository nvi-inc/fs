 Comments: 
 MAT module functions available. See section 1.0 of this
 manual.
 
 The use of * as a parameter is not supported by this command.
 
 Note that a VLBA or Mark IV track number equals the Mark III
 track number plus 3. Consequently, odd Mark III tracks are
 even VLBA or Mark IV track numbers and vice-versa. See the
 Track Assignment Tables in the System Setup manual. Also VLBA
 group numbers equal Mark III group numbers minus one, but the
 VLBA groups include additional tracks. Note that this command
 uses Mark III track and group numbers.
