           calrx - band/receiver calibration file link

            Syntax:     calrx=name,type,lo1,lo2

            Response:   calrx/name,type,lo1,lo2


Settable parameters:
        name    Name of a .rxg control file (only the part of the name
        before the dot should be used).
          type      LO definition type "fixed" or "range"
        lo1     First fixed LO value for type fixed or lower end of
        range for type range, MHz.
        lo2     Second fixed LO value for type fixed (may be null if no

Comments:
This command is used to provide the link between the log file
containing onoff progra, data that will be analyzed using the
gnplt program and the corresponding .rxg file that defines the
receiver parameters for that band. This command must be
entered into the log that contains the data for the band.
Usually it would be entered in the ACQUIRE procedure used to
set-up data acquisition for that band. Each band should use a
unique log name. The LO definition parameters in the command
(type, lo1, lo2) must agree with the contents of the file specified
by name. You should omit the .rxg extension from the name in
the command.
