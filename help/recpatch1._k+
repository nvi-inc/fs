 Comments:
 This command specifies the wiring of the VCs to the K-4 input
 ports. This command has no effect on the hardware. It is an
 "information only" command.
 
 A recpatch= clears any pre-existing definition.
 
 The monitor response may consist of more than one line, but
 each line ends with a channel entry.
