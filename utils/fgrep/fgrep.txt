 
FGREP -- fast string search utility
  
Usage:   fgrep [-opts] pattern file-mask [> file/lu]
  
FGREP is a fast string search file utility modeled after the similarly
named program available under UNIX.
  
FGREP allows you to search for a specific ASCII pattern in a file or set
of files (using a file-mask). If the search pattern contains blanks or
other special characters, it must be surrounded by ` (apostrophe) as opposed
to " (quotes) as in the Unix shells.
 
Output redirection is supported. As in Unix, use the '>' character preceding
a file name or a device lu. The default is lu 1, or the user terminal.
  
Two anchor characters are supported as follows:
  
      ^   matches the search pattern beginning at column 1
      $   matches the search pattern at end of line
  
          [-opts]   -v all lines but those matching are listed
                    -x only lines matched in their entirety are printed
                    -c Only a count of matching lines is printed
                    -i ignore upper/lower distinction during comparison
                    -n Each line is preceded by its relative line number
                    -l list only file name where matching occurs
                       only the file name is printed if a match is found
                    -d debug mode. display every file name being searched
                       (non-Unix option)
                    -a ascii mode. search only ascii files (types 3, 4)
                       (non-Unix option)
 
          pattern:   a character string to be found in the search-file.
  
          file-mask: any RTE valid file descriptor. FGREP supports full file
                     masking (including UNIX's '*' and '-', and RTE's '@'
                     wildcards).
  
          [> file/lu]  will redirect the output to "file" or "lu"
  
Examples:
  
   fgrep ddd file1 > f.lst   searches for 'DDD' in 'file1' and send matching
                             lines to 'f.lst'
   fgrep -in ^ddd file1      searches for 'ddd' or 'DDD" in 'file1'. Each
                             matching line is preceded by line number. Only
                             lines matching beginning at column 1 are listed.
   fgrep -ic ddd file1       search for 'ddd' or 'DDD' inf 'file1', but only
                             print a count of matching lines
   fgrep -l ddd fil* >6      print only file-names of those files matching
                             'DDD' and redirect output to lu 6. Treat the *
                             character as RTE's @ wild-card.
   fgrep -n `$cds on` @.ftn  prints all lines matching `$cds on`, preceding
                             lines with their line numbers and file-names
                             where they occur (because of wild-card).
   fgrep -iv `^` file >file1 can be used to create a new file with all "null"
                             lines removed from the source file. These are
                             lines with a length of 0.
   fgrep -a pattern mask     will search for pattern in mask, but only those
                             which are ascii files (types 3,4) will be openned
   fgrep -d pattern mask     searched for pattern in mask. In this debug mode,
                             every file matching the mask will be printed.
The following is a comparison between UNIX's FGREP and this program:
  
                                       CI                  UNIX
  
             pattern case-folding:   default              not done
             pattern-delimiter:      use {`}              use {"}
             regular expressions:    no (use EDIT)        no (use GREP)
             line length:            1024 chars           1024 chars
             ASCII files:            yes                  yes
             binary files:           yes (shown as ASCII) no
             more than 1 search file
             in run string:          no (use file-mask)   yes
             file-redirection:       yes                  yes
             \ escape support        no                   yes (from shell)
