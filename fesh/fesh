Usage: $0 [options] OBSERVATION
Fetch schedule file for OBSERVATION from CDDIS

Options:
    -n     Fetch next observation in master schedule
    -d     DRUDG schedule with default settings 
           (needs STATION environment variable set to two letter id)
    -v     Verbose mode, drudg output printed to stdout
    -V     Print version and exit.
    -f     Force downloading of schedule from server and, if given 
           with '-d', re-run drudg
    -h     Print this message

fesh requires the STATION environment variable be set to the lower case
two-letter station code in, e.g.:

    setenv STATION gs #in ~/.login for tcsh or
    export STATION=gs #in ~/.profile for bash

fesh (curl actually) will prompt for an email to use as the password
for the anonymous ftp-ssl access. This can be avoided by setting a
working email address in the FESH_EMAIL variable, e.g.:

    setenv FESH_EMAIL user2@address #in ~/.login for tcsh or
    export FESH_EMAIL=user2@address #in ~/.profile for bash

The directories for .skd, .snp, and .prc files can be changed from
the usual by similarly setting SCHED_PATH, SNAP_PATH, and PROC_PATH.
These settings must agree with /usr2/control/skedf.ctl. For example,
to use /usr2/exper as the SCHED_DIR in fesh:

    setenv SCHED_PATH /usr2/exper #in ~/.login for tcsh or
    export SCHED_PATH=/usr2/exper #in ~/.profile for bash

The listing file goes under SCHED_PATH.

If you have FSL8 or other old distribution that does not support
curl ftp-ssl to CDDIS, but worked with the previous versions of
fesh that used wget for non-ssl ftp, you can restore the previous
behaviour with:

    setenv FESH_CDDIS_NOSSL 1 #in ~/.login for tcsh or
    export FESH_CDDIS_NOSSL=1 #in ~/.profile for bash

However, this method will no longer work when CDDIS stops support
of non-ssl ftp, which is expected at the end of October 2020.
