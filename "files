     PROGRAM FILES WILL TRANSFER A FILE TO THE HP FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE 
  
     LUCNTL IS THE LU THAT THE PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT COMMANDS FROM. 
     IT IS DEFINED TO BE THE LU THAT THE PROGRAM IS RUN FROM. 
  
     LU IS WHERE THE FILE IS ACCEPTED FROM.  LU IS SPECIFIED  
     AS THE FIRST RMPAR PARAMETER.  IF IT IS NOT SPECIFIED, 
     IT IS SET TO LUCNTL. 
  
     IMPORTANT NOTE - LU may NOT be the system console. The program will  
                      check this condition. 
  
     ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE - LU absolutely must be on DVF00  
                              (or one of its clones that support  
                              a read without master reset of the  
                              12966A card).  The program cannot check 
                              this condition.  If LU is not on DVF00, 
                              I don't have the faintest idea what will  
                              happen (aside from the program not working),  
                              but I suspect you won't like it.  
  
     THE FILE ACCEPTANCE IS ENDED BY A SPECIAL RECORD.  
     IF NOT OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, A NULL RECORD (NO CHARACTERS, JUST 
     A CR) WILL FORCE THE FILE TO BE CLOSED.  THE ALTERNATE MEANS 
     OF TERMINATING THE FILE IS BY A RECORD CONTAINING A SINGLE 
     CHARACTER (PLUS A CR, NATURALLY).  THIS CHARACTER MAY BE 
     SPECIFIED AS THE SECOND RMPAR PARAMETER EITHER BY TYPING THE CHARACTER 
     OR ITS OCTAL EQUIVALENT IF IT IS NONPRINTING.
  
     The file acceptance may also be ended by an operator break.  
     Type BR,FILES and wait for the pending read to complete (or timeout).  
  
     THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED ON LUCNTL FOR THE NAME OF THE  
     FILE TO BE STORED INTO.  UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, 
     THIS WILL BE A TYPE 4 FILE OF LENGTH 20 BLOCKS.  
  
     It is strongly recommended that the file be received to a hard 
     disc rather then a floppy.  The floppy is simply too slow. 
     If you use a floppy, you probably will lose information. 
  
A typical use of files is to load a file into the HP from a personal
computer through a modem.  The steps to do this are:
1) Connect to the HP and run FMGR.
2) :RU,FILES,,!   (if your file ends with a line that has just a ! on it  
                   followed immediately by a CR)  
3) Respond to FILES questions about the name of the file to be stored into. 
4) When FILES tells you it is ready, start sending the file to be captured. 
5) After you send the EOF record, FILES will tell you that it is done.
FILES will run locked into memory at priority 1.  It makes extensive use of 
Class I/O.  The LU that the file is received from is disabled and locked to 
FILES.  These conditions are remedied when FILES terminates normally.
