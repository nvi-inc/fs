    In order to use this version, two environment variables are
    required to be set in ~/.cshrc:

      setenv PGPLOT_DIR /usr/lib/pgplot
      setenv PGPLOT_DEV /xwin

    The first variable depends on the place where pgplot is
    installed. For some systems /usr/local/lib/pgplot is appropriate.
