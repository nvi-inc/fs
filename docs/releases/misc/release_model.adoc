= Strawman Release Model
Version 1.1 - February 2021

:sectnums:

This document briefly describes the version tags, release model,
update notice, version checkout, and branches used with the FS _git_
repo. It also outlines the steps in initial and update installs of the
FS, including from an archive, and sending changes to the maintainers.

== Version tags

An example version _tag_ is:

   10.1.0-beta1

The general form of FS version tags is:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
__MAJOR__.__MINOR__.__PATCH__-__STRING__
....

Where:

* `_MAJOR_`, a number, indicates a major release, e.g., `10`.  Note
   that `_MAJOR_` does not start with a `v`.

*  `_MINOR_`, a number, indicates a minor release, e.g., `1`.

*  `_PATCH_`, a number, indicate the patch number, e.g., `0`.
   Non-zero patch numbers are only used for fixes to
   `__MAJOR__.__MINOR__` releases (before version _10.0.0_, non-zero
   ``_PATCH_``s were used in regular releases).

*  `_STRING_`, a string, which is optional and when non-blank provides
   additional information, e.g., `beta1`. If `_STRING_` is empty, the
   dash `-` is omitted.

If the version tag has changed since the last time the FS was _made_,
the version tag is inserted in the FS (and _drudg_) code
and compiled in.  If
the version that is made does not correspond to a tagged commit, additional
information is automatically appended to identify the specific commit, e.g.:

  10.0.0-beta1-58-g229f696e

The general form of what is appended is:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
-_n_-g__SHA__-dirty
....

where:

*  `_n_` is the number of commits that have been been made since the last
   commit tagged with a version string, e.g., `58`.

*  `_SHA_` is the (unique) SHA prefix of this commit, e.g., `229f696e`.

*  `-dirty` is appended if the working directory contains changes that
   have not been committed. When -dirty appears, the ability to identify
   what version was run is lost. This should be avoided.

This format is only present for versions _10.0.0-alpha2_ and later.

== Release model

When an FS release is made, a particular commit is tagged with the version. A
lightweight tag is sufficient, but an annotated tag can be used.  Official
releases never have a non-blank `_STRING_`.  However, alpha and beta releases will
have appropriate `_STRING_` values, e.g. _alpha1_, _beta2_, etc.  Other values may
be used as needed.

There is a basic distinction between `__MAJOR__.__MINOR__.0`,
i.e., with zero `_PATCH_`, a _feature release_, and non-zero
`_PATCH_`, a _patch release_.  Generally feature releases include
significant feature changes, but also occur when a patch is not just a
"`quick`" install for the users. A patch that requires significant
changes, including, but not limited to reboots due to changes in
shared memory size, should be promoted to being a feature release. The
goal is that patch releases should be safe for operational stations to
install without needing a significant amount of time, testing, or
otherwise being a risk to operations.

== Update notices

For each release, there should be an _update notice_ in a file of the form

[subs="+quotes"]
....
__/usr2/fs/docs/releases/<MAJOR>/<MINOR>/<tag>.adoc__
....

documenting the changes in the version and installation instructions.
There may also be documents using the `_STRING_` and other files
associated with the release, including patches, in the same
sub-directory, e.g., _beta1.adoc_, _beta2.adoc_,
_beta1_to_beta2.adoc_, _<STRING>_to_latest.adoc_, and _10.0.1.adoc_.
All these files should be visible on the _gh-pages_.

For feature releases, the notice should have a complete description of
the changes and installation instructions from the previous feature
release.

For patch releases, the description and instructions should be
complete for an update from the corresponding feature release and
include those instructions (by reference).

A _<tag>_to_latest.adoc_ file covers changes on that branch since the
most recent feature or maintenance release. It starts as basically
empty for a new release. It accumulates the changes that occur until
the next release. It helps provide content for the next release update
notes. At a new release it is converted to a new _<tag>.adoc_ file for
the new _<tag>_.

NOTE: Those using the latest commit are understood to be experts and
are expected to manage differences in the update steps when updating to
the next release themselves. Advice may be helpful of course, but
documentation is not provided.

== Branches

The main branch in the repo is _master_. This is the branch that is
checked out after a clone operation from _github_.  The _master_
branch represents the main line of development and should include most
of the feature releases.

In order to patch an existing feature release, a _maintenance branch_
is normally used.  For example, to create a maintenance branch _10.2_
for feature release _10.2.0_:

   git checkout -b 10.2 10.2.0

The changes created on any maintenance release should be _rebased_
onto _master_ as soon as they are stable. Maintenance branches should
be retained long term both for possible future extension and to
preserve the history.

To develop a new feature, a _feature branch_ can be created at any
point. Likewise, for _bug fix_ branches.  Once they are considered to
be stabilized enough they are merged into the appropriate branch,
_master_ or a maintenance branch, and then deleted.

Patch releases are normally made on maintenance branches.  However, if
a patch is needed and there have been no changes on _master_ since the
corresponding feature release, the patch can be released on the
_master_ (probably having been developed on a bug fix branch first).
Otherwise, a maintenance branch should be made.

Despite feature releases normally being on the _master_ branch, a
feature release may occur on a different branch for a patch that has
been promoted to a feature release.  In this case, a maintenance
branch for a new feature release is created at the tip of the existing
maintenance branch, if it exists. For example, to make a _10.3_
maintenance branch off the _10.2_ maintenance branch:

   git checkout -b 10.3 10.2

and the new feature release is placed on the new branch.  Likewise, a
maintenance branch can created from a patch release on _master_:

   git checkout -b 10.2 10.2.1

== Version checkout

It is always possible to get a specific release version by checking
out the `_tag_` for its version string:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
git checkout _tag_
....

Commits that do not have a version tag are not considered releases.  Users can
check them out, but they may have bugs and/or incompatibilities with local
files and station software of the previous tagged version.

The last commit on a branch, the _tip_, is checked out with:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
git checkout _branch_
....

It is not necessary that unreleased commits on _master_ or a maintenance branch
be in a state that is releasable. However, it is helpful to developers, and to
a lessor extent for users, for the branch tips be in a usable state. This is
largely achieved by not _merging_ or _rebasing_ feature branches into the branch
that aren't in a fairly complete state.  However, it is acceptable to make new
commits significantly changing the impact of previous commits, if they still
result in a usable tip.

== Making a release

Before a release is made, the update notes should be prepared. For
feature releases, the instructions should include all steps to upgrade
from the previous feature release. If there were significant changes
in patch releases for that version, they can be included by reference
to the last patch release instructions at the time of the new feature
release. A description of the changes should be included as well.

For patch releases, the installation instructions can be abbreviated
to cover just what is necessary to upgrade from the corresponding
feature release plus instructions for all previous patches for that
feature release.  Covering all the previous patch releases, should not
be hard, since previous patch notes can be included explicitly or by
reference.  A description of what has been fixed should included.

To make a release:

. Finalize release, including update notes, committing all changes.
+
Final commit message: ``**Finalize** _tag_``

. ``**git push**``
. ``**git tag** __tag__``
. ``**git push --tags**``
. Change to the _docs/_ sub-directory
. Generate and push the _.html_ files to the _gh-pages_ branch on _github_.
+
Directions are in _making_gh-pages.txt_.

. On the github page for the repo, select `release`
. Select `Draft a new release`
. Enter version string as an existing tag and select branch
. Enter a release message as the `Description`
. Leave `Title` blank
+  
Do not include `*pre-release*` or the version `_tag_` in `Title` since they
are automatically prepended to the announcement email.
. If not for production, select `This is a pre-release`
. Select `Publish Release`

== Installation 

To find the most recent release for installation, go to:

https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/releases

Typically, you should use the most recent patch release for the most
recent feature release. If there have not been any patch releases for
that feature release, use that feature release itself, i.e., with the
version string ending in zero. Versions with a trailing _-string_ are
not intended for production.  Use the tag of the release you have
chosen for `_tag_` in the instructions below.

=== First time FS installation

As _root_, execute: 

.   ``**cd /usr2**``
.   ``**git clone \https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs fs-git**``
.   ``**cd fs-git**``
.   ``**git checkout -q** _tag_``
+

Use the version `_tag_` of the release you are installing.
.   ``**make install**``
+
Answer `*y*` to confirm installation
.   Log-out as _root_ and log-in as _prog_
.   ``**make >&/dev/null**``
.   ``**make -s**``
+
If there is no output from the above command, then the _make_ was successful.
.   Reboot

You can then login as _oper_ and run the FS, but you will need to
customize the control files in _/usr2/control_ before you can do
anything useful. Additionally, you may need to add station software,
particularly _antcn_ if you want to control an antenna

=== Installing FS updates

As _prog_:

.   ``**cd /usr2/fs-git**``
.   ``**git fetch**``
.   ``**git checkout -q** _tag_``

+

Use the version `_tag_` of the release you are installing.
.   ``**make >&/dev/null**``
.   ``**make -s**``
+
If there is no output from the above command, then the _make_ was successful.
.   Reboot
+
A patch update may not require a reboot, please check the instructions.

Additionally, you will need to follow the update instructions. There
is usually a link to them in the release announcement, which can be
found at https://nvi-inc.github.io/fs/releases/.

=== Installing from an archive

The main method of distributing the FS is with the _git_ repo from
_github_. This makes updates, particularly patches,  much easier
to install. However, if it is not possible to use _git_, you can get a
_.tar.gz_ archive from the release page.

To install from the archive (use the `_tag_` of the release you are installing):

.   Log in as _root_
.   ``**cd /tmp**``
.   ``**wget \https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/archive/**__tag__**.tar.gz**``
+

TIP: If you don't have _wget_ or if there another problem with it,
such as its TLS version is too old (this is the case for FSL8), you can
retrieve the archive on a different local machine and move it to
_/tmp_ on the FS machine.


.   ``**cd /usr2**``
.   ``**tar xzf /tmp/**__tag__**.tar.gz**``
.   ``**cd /usr2/fs-**__tag__``

. At this point you have two options:

..  Set _/usr2/fs_ link, file ownerships, and file permissions
+

If this is a first time installation of the FS or it is an update that
you want to use immediately, then execute:

   make install
+
Answer `*y*` to confirm installation

.. Set only the ownerships and permissions
+

If you only want to build this version and not make it operational
yet, then execute:

  chown -R prog.rtx .
  chmod -R a+r,u+w,go-w .

.   Log out as _root_ and log in as _prog_
.   ``**cd /usr2/fs-**__tag__``
.   ``**make >&/dev/null**``
.   ``**make -s**``
+

If there is no output from this command, then the _make_ was
successful.

. If you set the _/usr2/fs_ link by using `make install` above, then
reboot.

If this is a first time installation, you can then login as _oper_ and
run the FS, but you will need to customize the control files in
_/usr2/control_ before you can do anything useful.  Additionally, you
may need to add station software, particularly _antcn_ if you want to
control an antenna.

If this an update, you will need to follow the update instructions.
There is usually a link to them in the release announcement, which can
be found at https://nvi-inc.github.io/fs/releases/.

== Managing testing of FS updates

#TODO: develop and write#

== Users sending code changes to developer

#TODO: patches? fork/pull-request?. It would be good to preserve commit SHAs
for tracing versions using stations, if possible.#
