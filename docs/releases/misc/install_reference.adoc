= Installation reference
Version 0.2 - November 2020

:sectnums:
:experimental:

This document collects several topics that are useful for installation
in general, but are usually not needed for routine updates.

== Upgrading from FS versions before the previous stable

This section only covers upgrading from "main" branch versions,
i.e., versions _9.12.x_ are excluded.

For reference, the list of the most recent _critical updates_, since
version _9.3.13_, is given below.  These are updates that must be
applied sequentially.  Please start with the next update with a later
version number than what you have and apply it and the following
listed versions before upgrading to the new version.  You can find the
latest versions of installation notes for these FS versions in the
_/usr2/fs/misc_ directory.  The list of critical updates is:

  9.4.0
  9.5.3
  9.5.12
  9.6.9
  9.7.7
  9.9.2
  9.10.4
  9.11.6
  9.11.8
  9.11.19
  9.13.2

Strictly speaking you do not need to actually use the source archives
(_.tgz_ files) of the previous versions.  You can just follow the steps
in the upgrade notices for your local files for the corresponding FS
versions.  However, it can be very helpful to actually install each
version to help make sure that all of the upgrade steps have been
completed and that the FS will run _and_ to test it as described.
This can be particularly helpful when the upgrade requires some
modifications to your local programs.  So it probably best to actually
install _and_ test each version along the way.  This is especially
true if you have to upgrade through more than one previous version.
Otherwise if a step was overlooked, it might be hard to identify for
which version the error was made.

You can find the archives for old versions at: http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/dist/old/

They can also be extracted from a local FS _git_ repo with, e.g.:

  git checkout 9.11.19

If you have a version older than _9.3.13_, please email
Ed for more information.

== Example standard procedure libraries

For reference purposes, information about the example station
libraries for different equipment configurations is given here.  The
files are found in _/usr2/fs/st.default/proc_.  They can be referred to
and compared to what you have in _/usr2/proc/station.prc_.

_Only_ for new installations (or complete re-installs), you can copy
the default version for your equipment to _/usr2/proc_ renaming it to
_station.prc_ in the process, e.g.:

  cd /usr2/proc
  cp -i /usr2/fs/st.default/proc/3station.prc station.prc
  chmod a+rw station.prc

The `-i` option will prompt before overwriting an existing
_station.prc_ to give you a chance to recover if you did not realize
you already had a _station.prc_ file.  The table of correspondence
between equipment types and default library names is given next.

If an example for your equipment type is listed, please email
Ed about it so that it can be added.

== Cut-and-paste installation tips

You can use cut-and-paste to reduce the amount of typing involved in
the installation.  This reduces the chances of missing required spaces
and other easily missed characters (like `.`) in the commands.  The
basic idea is to have two different terminals open, _either_ (preferred)
two different xterm terminals either on the local X display or
remotely logged in _or_ (more cumbersome) two different VT text
terminals (kbd:[Control+Alt+Fn]) on the FS computer you are
upgrading.  You can then switch back and forth between the terminals,
reading the instructions as you scroll through them (with _more_ or
_less_) on one terminal and entering commands on the other.  You can
cut-and-paste complicated commands from the terminal with the
instructions to the terminal where you are entering commands as
needed.  You can use _ssh_ or _su_ to switch users as needed on
the terminal where you are entering commands. For example, you can
change to being _prog_ by executing:

 ssh -X prog@localhost

or

 su - prog

Please don't forget to log back out when you need to change users
again or you may develop a series of _nested_ logins.  Any steps that
require rebooting will of course completely log out all of your
terminals; you will need to re-login again from scratch to continue.
At the end of the update, it is recommended that you login as _oper_
on the local X display for the final testing.  Please also note that
in order to paste into the X display login shell window for _oper_ and
_prog_, you typically must use kbd:[Shift+Insert].  If you have any
questions about how to cut-and-paste please email Ed.

== Making a back-up before installing

This section has two parts. The first covers back-ups. The second
covers using symbolic links to switch between operational and test
set-ups.

=== Back-ups

Before you begin the upgrade make sure you have a current back-up of
your system in case something goes wrong. If you are using one of the
FSLx distributions, there are options for each below

If you have SCSI disks, Section 5.7 of the FS9 _Computer Reference_
manual has a discussion of drive ID numbers if you are unsure about
these.

Except for FSL10 (which uses a different scheme), you would normally
choose to install the update on your primary disk after having made
and verified your back-up.  Once the installation is complete, has
been tested, and used for a little while, you can copy over your
back-up with the upgraded primary.  If the upgrade fails, you should
restore the back-up to the primary for operations.  You can then try
to upgrade again when it is convenient.  In a desperate situation, you
can use the back-up for operations.  You may choose to install the FS
on your back-up disk for testing and then later copy the back-up onto
the primary once you are satisfied with the new version.  In any
event, please be sure to make a fresh back-up (and put it safely away)
before attempting an update installation.

====  FSL10 (stretch)

See the procedure at: https://nvi-inc.github.io/fsl10/raid.html#_recoverable_testing

====  FSL9 (wheezy)

If the system is configured as a RAID, please see
_/usr2/fs/misc/FSL9_RAID.pdf_ section "APPLYING AN UPDATE" for directions
for applying an update.

====  FSL8 (lenny), FSL7, (etch), and FSL6 (sarge)

If the system is configured as a RAID, please see http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/docs/pre_FSL9_RAID.pdf
section "APPLYING AN UPDATE" for directions for
applying an update.

====  FSL5 (woody)

We recommend you use the _tar_ based back-up that is part of the
rotating disk back-up scheme.  A draft document that describes this
method is available in http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/docs/backups2.pdf.

====  FSL4 (potato) and earlier

If you have an even older FS Linux distribution, please use the
disk-to-disk back scheme described in Section 5.8 of the FS9 _Computer
Reference_ manual.

If you are running one of these FSLx distributions and do not have
documentation on how to make a back-up, please email
Ed for advice.

=== Using symbolic links

_After_ you have made a backup (to allow recovery in case something
bad should happen), you can use symbolic links to your directories to
change between your operational and test directories.  This may allow
you to more easily switch between an operational and testing
configuration.

In the following examples, it is assumed that _/usr2/fs-9.13.2_ is
your operational FS version and the FS you want to test is in
_/usr2/fs-git_ and that _/usr2/st-1.0.0_ is the directory with your
station software; you should substitute the correct directories if
they are different. All commands must be entered as _root_. Extra
white space has been added only to improve legibility.

If you have aliased `rm` to `rm -i` and `mv` to `mv -i` and `cp` to
`cp -i`, you will prompted to confirm before anything destructive
occurs. If so, and if everything is set-up properly below, the only
cases where you should only be asked to confirm is for deleting the
symbolic links in examples for <<Switch permanently to new version>>
and <<Switch permanently to old operational version>>.

==== To set-up initially for testing:

Your operational station software is assumed to be in _/usr2/st-1.0.0_. Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the command:

  cd /usr2
+
Make sure there are no existing directories: _control-ops_,
_proc-ops_, _st-1.0.0-ops_, _control-test_, _proc-test_,
_st-1.0.0-test_, or use different names and adjust this and
other examples accordingly.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
mv control   control-ops
mv proc      proc-ops
mv st-1.0.0  st-1.0.0-ops

cp -a control-ops   control-test
cp -a proc-ops      proc-test
cp -a st-1.0.0-ops  st-1.0.0-test

ln -sfn control-test  control
ln -sfn proc-test     proc
ln -sfn st-1.0.0-test st
....

. Then follow the installation instructions, you will be
modifying the _-test_ versions.

==== Switch temporarily to operational version

Your operational FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-9.13.2_
and your operational station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2
ln -sfn control-ops   control
ln -sfn proc-ops      proc
ln -sfn st-1.0.0-ops  st
ln -sfn fs-9.13.2     fs
....

. Reboot.

The above commands (even rebooting if you like) can be put in
a script if you need to do this multiple times.

==== Switch temporarily to test version

Your test FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-git_
and your test station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0-test_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2
ln -sfn control-test   control
ln -sfn proc-test      proc
ln -sfn st-1.0.0-test  st
ln -sfn fs-git         fs
....

. Reboot.

The above commands (even rebooting if you like) can be put in
a script if you need to do this multiple times.

==== Switch permanently to new version

When you are satisfied with the testing of the new system
you can switch permanently.

Your test FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-git_
and your test station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0-test_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2

rm  control
rm  proc

mv control-test   control
mv proc-test      proc
mv st-1.0.0-test  st-1.0.0

ln -sfn st-1.0.0  st
ln -sfn fs-git    fs
....

. Reboot.

Your old operational directories (named _*-ops_) are left for possible future
reference.

==== Switch permanently to old operational version

Follow these steps if you need to switch back permanently, perhaps
because the installation failed.

Your operational FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-9.13.2_
and your operational station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2

rm control
rm proc

mv control-ops   control
mv proc-ops      proc
mv st-1.0.0-ops  st-1.0.0

ln -sfn st-1.0.0  st
ln -sfn fs-9.13.2 fs
....

. Reboot.

Your old test directories (named _*-test_) are left for possible future reference.

== Disk space requirements

Please be sure that you have at least 50 MB of free space (use the
_df_ UNIX command to check free space) on your _/usr2_ partition
before starting the upgrade.  This would probably only be an issue for
stations with 200 MB disks.  If you are tight on space, you may want
to delete old log files and old versions of the FS (except your most
recent one if you can avoid it of course).  Since you should have
backed-up your system, you can even delete the _*.[oas]_ and
executable files of your old versions with no risk.  You might want to
keep the source of the previous versions around for reference if you
have room.  You can eliminate the non-source files by _cd_-ing to each
of the old FS directories in turn as _prog_ and executing:

  make rmdoto rmexe

as a shell command.  If you have any questions about how to do this,
please email Ed.

== Set operations file permissions

It is recommended that your local files for operations (_control_, _proc_,
_log_, _sched_, _tle_files_ directories and their contents) have the default
ownership (`oper.rtx`) and permissions (for regular files `rw-rw-r-`,
for directories `rwxrwxr-x`).  To force this (however, this will not
change the "execute/search" permissions), please execute the script (as
_root_):

  /usr2/fs/misc/fix_perm

Answer `*y*` to the prompt if you wish to proceed.  It is a good idea to
do this, unless you have purposely changed the ownership and
permissions to some other values.  If you don't want to restore the
defaults, answer `*n*` (this is the last chance to abort the execution
of the script). If you don't have a _/usr2/tle_files_ directory,
you will get a message that there is no such directory.

== Fix .prc file define lines

Sometimes due to errors (possibly caused during manual editing,
instead of using _pfmed_), the `define` statements in _.prc_ files can
be damaged.  This can lead to other problems including causing the
contents of procedures being logged every time they are executed
rather than just the first time they are used in a given log file.
You can use the utility, _/usr2/fs/misc/fix_define_, to fix this. You
can run it when the FS is _not active_ (as _oper_):

  cd /usr2/proc
  /usr2/fs/misc/fix_define -t *.prc

in _test_ mode to see if there any `define` statements that need to be
fixed.  If there are, they will be displayed.  If you choose to fix
them, you can re-run the second command above without the `-t` flag to
apply the fix.  An original of each _.prc_ file that is changed is
retained with an added _.bak_ extension.
