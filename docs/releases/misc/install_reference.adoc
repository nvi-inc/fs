= Installation Reference
Version 1.4 - August 2021

:sectnums:
:experimental:

This document collects several topics that are useful for installation
in general, but are usually not needed for routine updates.

== Upgrading from FS versions before the previous stable

This section only covers upgrading from "`main`" branch versions,
i.e., versions _9.12.<x>_ are excluded.

For reference, the list of the most recent _critical updates_, since
version _9.3.13_, is given below.  These are updates that must be
applied sequentially.  Please start with the next update with a later
version number than what you have and apply it and the following
listed versions before upgrading to the new version.  You can find the
latest versions of installation notes for these FS versions in the
_/usr2/fs/misc_ sub-directory.  The list of critical updates is:

  9.4.0
  9.5.3
  9.5.12
  9.6.9
  9.7.7
  9.9.2
  9.10.4
  9.11.6
  9.11.8
  9.11.19
  9.13.2

Strictly speaking you do not need to actually use the source archives
(_.tgz_ files) of the previous versions.  You can just follow the steps
in the upgrade notices for your local files for the corresponding FS
versions.  However, it can be very helpful to actually install each
version to help make sure that all of the upgrade steps have been
completed and that the FS will run _and_ to test it as described.
This can be particularly helpful when the upgrade requires some
modifications to your local programs.  So it probably best to actually
install _and_ test each version along the way.  This is especially
true if you have to upgrade through more than one previous version.
Otherwise if a step was overlooked, it might be hard to identify for
which version the error was made.

If you have a version older than _9.3.13_, please email Ed for more
information.

[NOTE]
====

There are three suggested methods for getting archives of old versions
if you need them:

. You can find archives for old versions at:
http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/dist/old/

. The _.tgz_ archives can  be extracted from a local FS _git_ repo. In
the following, use the tag of the release you want to extract, e.g.,
_9.11.19_, in place of `_tag_` in:

+

[subs="+quotes"]
....
cd /usr2/fs-git
make TAG=_tag_ tag_archive
....
+

This will place the _fs-<tag>.tgz_ archive in _/tmp_. In these
archives, the files will have the prefix `usr2/fs-_tag_/`.

. You can get a _.tar.gz_ archive from _github_ with:

+

[subs="+quotes"]
....
wget https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/archive/_tag_.tar.gz
....
+

This will place the _fs-<tag>.tar.gz_ archive in the current
directory. In these archives, the files will have the prefix
`fs-_tag_/`.

The latter two methods will work for the versions listed above as far
back as _9.5.3_. It could be extended to older versions if needed.

====

== Example standard procedure libraries

For reference purposes, information about the example station
libraries for different equipment configurations is given here.  The
files are found in _/usr2/fs/st.default/proc_.  They can be referred to
and compared to what you have in _/usr2/proc/station.prc_.

_Only_ for new installations (or complete re-installs), you can copy
the default version for your equipment to _/usr2/proc_ renaming it to
_station.prc_ in the process, e.g.:

  cd /usr2/proc
  cp -i /usr2/fs/st.default/proc/3station.prc station.prc
  chmod a+rw station.prc

The `-i` option will prompt before overwriting an existing
_station.prc_ to give you a chance to recover if you did not realize
you already had a _station.prc_ file.  The table of correspondence
between equipment types and default library names is given next.

|=============================================================

If an example for your equipment type is listed, please email
Ed about it so that it can be added.

== Copy-and-paste installation tips

You can use copy-and-paste to reduce the amount of typing involved in
the installation. This reduces the chances of missing required spaces
and other easily missed characters (like `.`) in the commands.

The basic approach is to view the instructions in a Web browser (or
PDF viewer) window while working in a shell window that contains a
session on the FS computer. This allows you to read the instructions
and copy commands from them, pasting them into the shell window as
needed.

There are least two ways to arrange this:

. Work from a different computer with a comfortable display, tools for
Web browsing (or PDF viewing), and _ssh_ to reach the target computer.
+

In this case you can read the instructions on the other computer,
performing the installation steps in a shell window where you have
connected to the FS computer. You can use the normal copy-and-paste
tools of the other computer to copy input from the document and paste
them into the session on the FS computer. If this is possible, it is
often the most convenient.

. Work on the X display of the FS.
+

In this case you can use a Web browser (or PDF viewer) on the FS
computer to read the document and a terminal to enter commends. This
is very similar to the previous option, but may not have as much
screen real estate to work with. You can switch between windows using
the kbd:[Alt+Tab] short-cut.
+

TIP: You may prefer to work in an _xterm_ other than the `login shell`
since that _xterm_ normally requires using kbd:[Shift+Insert] to
paste.

NOTE: For previous updates a possible technique was to use console
text terminals on the FS computer. You can use (kbd:[Control+Alt+Fn])
to switch between a terminal to view the text instructions (with
_less_) and a terminal for entering commands. This was always a
cumbersome option. Now with the installation document in HTML format,
it may no longer feasible unless you have a way to make a usable text
version of the document. If you do, please let Ed know so that can be
included here for others to use.

You can use _ssh_ or _su_ to switch users as needed on in the window
where you are entering commands. For example, you can change to being
_prog_ by executing:

 ssh -X prog@localhost

or

 su - prog

Please don't forget to log back out when you need to change users
again or you may develop a series of _nested_ logins.  Any steps that
require rebooting will of course completely log out all of your
terminals; you will need to re-login again from scratch to continue.

At the end of the update, it is recommended that you login as _oper_
for testing with whatever configuration you usually use for
operations.

== Making a back-up before installing

This section has two sub-sections:

. <<Back-ups>> covering how to make back-ups on varions FSL__x__
distributions.

. <<Using symbolic links>> for using symbolic links to switch between
operational and test set-ups.

=== Back-ups

Before you begin the upgrade make sure you have a current back-up of
your system in case something goes wrong. If you are using one of the
FSL__x__ distributions, there are options for each below.

If you have SCSI disks, Section 5.7 of the FS9 _Computer Reference_
manual has a discussion of drive ID numbers if you are unsure about
these.

If you are using a RAID, except for FSL10 (which uses a different
scheme), you would normally choose to install the update on your
primary disk after having made and verified your back-up.  Once the
installation is complete, has been tested, and used for a little
while, you can copy over your back-up with the upgraded primary.  If
the upgrade fails, you should restore the back-up to the primary for
operations.  You can then try to upgrade again when it is convenient.
In a desperate situation, you can use the back-up for operations.  You
may choose to install the FS on your back-up disk for testing and then
later copy the back-up onto the primary once you are satisfied with
the new version.  In any event, please be sure to make a fresh back-up
(and put it safely away) before attempting an update installation.

====  FSL10 (stretch)

If the system is configured as a RAID, please see the procedure at:

https://nvi-inc.github.io/fsl10/raid.html#_recoverable_testing

====  FSL9 (wheezy)

If the system is configured as a RAID, please see
_/usr2/fs/misc/FSL9_RAID.pdf_ section "`APPLYING AN UPDATE`" for directions
for applying an update.

====  FSL8 (lenny), FSL7, (etch), and FSL6 (sarge)

If the system is configured as a RAID, please see http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/docs/pre_FSL9_RAID.pdf
section "`APPLYING AN UPDATE`" for directions for
applying an update.

That _.pdf_ file can also be extracted from a local FS _git_ repo with:

  cd /usr2/fs-git
  git show 9.11.0:misc/RAID.pdf >/tmp/pre_FSL9_RAID.pdf

====  FSL5 (woody)

We recommend you use the _tar_ based back-up that is part of the
rotating disk back-up scheme.  A draft document that describes this
method is available in http://www.metsahovi.fi/fs/docs/backups2.pdf.

====  FSL4 (potato) and earlier

If you have an even older FS Linux distribution, please use the
disk-to-disk back scheme described in Section 5.8 of the FS9 _Computer
Reference_ manual.

If you are running one of these FSL__x__ distributions and do not have
documentation on how to make a back-up, please email Ed for advice.

=== Using symbolic links

_After_ you have made a backup (to allow recovery in case something
bad should happen), you can use symbolic links to your directories to
change between your operational and test directories.  This may allow
you to more easily switch between operational and testing
configurations.

In the following examples, it is assumed that _/usr2/fs-9.13.2_ is
your operational FS version and the FS you want to test is in
_/usr2/fs-git_ and that _/usr2/st-1.0.0_ is the directory with your
station software; you should substitute the correct directories if
they are different. All commands must be entered as _root_. Extra
white space has been added only to improve legibility.

[NOTE]
====

You can also use this scheme to switch back and forth between
different FS _git_ repos, but you will have to give the new git repo a
different name than the old repo, which may be in _/usr2/fs-git_.  One
possible scheme is to clone a new repo for each new version and
include the version tag in the name of the _git_ repo. For example,
_10.0.0_ could go in _/usr2/fs-git-10.0.0_.

This approach goes against the spirit of _git_,  with which it is
possible to `checkout` and re__make__ the executables for any version
included in the repo. However, it may be more reassuring to know that
you have preserved the current, known to work, executables of your
operational system.

====

If you have aliased `rm` to `rm -i` and `mv` to `mv -i` and `cp` to
`cp -i` (all of which are recommended), you will be prompted to
confirm before anything destructive occurs. If so, and if everything
is set-up properly below, the only cases where you should be asked to
confirm is for deleting the symbolic links in the examples for
<<Switch permanently to new version>> and
<<Switch permanently to old operational version>> below.

==== To set-up initially for testing:

Your operational station software is assumed to be in _/usr2/st-1.0.0_. Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the command:

  cd /usr2
+
Make sure there are no existing directories: _control-ops_,
_proc-ops_, _st-1.0.0-ops_, _control-test_, _proc-test_,
_st-1.0.0-test_, or use different names and adjust the commands
below accordingly.

[CAUTION]
====

If you are currently using  _/usr2/control_ and _/usr2/proc_ as
symbolic links, you will need to resolve that first or modify the
commands below to take that into account. You can check if they are
symbolic links using, for example:

  ls -ld /usr2/control

One way to resolve this is to delete the symbolic links and rename the
directories they pointed to with the names of the corresponding
symbolic links.

====

. Enter the commands:
+
....
mv control   control-ops
mv proc      proc-ops
mv st-1.0.0  st-1.0.0-ops

cp -a control-ops   control-test
cp -a proc-ops      proc-test
cp -a st-1.0.0-ops  st-1.0.0-test

ln -sfn control-test  control
ln -sfn proc-test     proc
ln -sfn st-1.0.0-test st
....

. Then follow the installation instructions. You will be
modifying the _-test_ versions.

==== Switch temporarily to operational version

Your operational FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-9.13.2_
and your operational station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2
ln -sfn control-ops   control
ln -sfn proc-ops      proc
ln -sfn st-1.0.0-ops  st
ln -sfn fs-9.13.2     fs
....

. Reboot.

The above commands (even rebooting if you like) can be put in
a script if you need to do this multiple times.

==== Switch temporarily to test version

Your test FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-git_
and your test station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0-test_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2
ln -sfn control-test   control
ln -sfn proc-test      proc
ln -sfn st-1.0.0-test  st
ln -sfn fs-git         fs
....

. Reboot.

The above commands (even rebooting if you like) can be put in
a script if you need to do this multiple times.

==== Switch permanently to new version

When you are satisfied with the testing of the new system
you can switch permanently.

Your test FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-git_
and your test station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0-test_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2

rm  control
rm  proc

mv control-test   control
mv proc-test      proc
mv st-1.0.0-test  st-1.0.0

ln -sfn st-1.0.0  st
ln -sfn fs-git    fs
....

. Reboot.

Your old operational directories (named _*-ops_) remain available for
future reference.

==== Switch permanently to old operational version

Follow these steps if you need to switch back permanently, perhaps
because the installation failed.

Your operational FS version is assumed here to be in _/usr2/fs-9.13.2_
and your operational station software is assumed to be in
_/usr2/st-1.0.0_.  Make appropriate adjustments if they are different.

. Make sure the FS is not running.

. Enter the commands:
+
....
cd /usr2

rm control
rm proc

mv control-ops   control
mv proc-ops      proc
mv st-1.0.0-ops  st-1.0.0

ln -sfn st-1.0.0  st
ln -sfn fs-9.13.2 fs
....

. Reboot.

Your old test directories (named _*-test_) remain available for future
reference.

== Disk space requirements

Please be sure that you have at least 50 MB of free space (use the
`*df -h /usr2*` UNIX command to check free space on your _/usr2_
partition) before starting the upgrade. This would probably only be
an issue for stations with 200 GB, or smaller, disks.

If you are tight on space, you may want to compress old log files and
delete old versions of the FS (except your most recent one of course).
Since you should have backed-up your system that should be safe. You
can be safer, if you only delete the _*.[oas]_ and executable files of
your old versions (except your most recent one of course).  You might
want to keep the source of the previous versions around for reference
if you have room.  You can eliminate the non-source files by _cd_-ing
to each of the old FS directories in turn as _prog_ and executing:

  make rmdoto rmexe

as a shell command.  If you have any questions about how to do this,
please email Ed.

== Set operations file permissions

It is recommended that your local files for operations (_control_, _proc_,
_log_, _sched_, _tle_files_ directories and their contents) have the default
ownership (`oper.rtx`) and permissions (for regular files `rw-rw-r-`,
for directories `rwxrwxr-x`).  To force this (however, this will not
change the "`execute/search`" permissions), please execute the script (as
_root_):

  /usr2/fs/misc/fix_perm

Answer `*y*` to the prompt if you wish to proceed.  It is a good idea to
do this, unless you have purposely changed the ownership and
permissions to some other values.  If you don't want to restore the
defaults, answer `*n*` (this is the last chance to abort the execution
of the script). If you don't have a _/usr2/tle_files_ directory,
you will get a message that there is no such directory.

== Fix .prc file define lines

Sometimes due to errors (possibly caused during manual editing,
instead of using _pfmed_), the `define` statements in _.prc_ files can
be damaged.  This can lead to other problems including causing the
contents of procedures being logged every time they are executed
rather than just the first time they are used in a given log file.
You can use the utility, _/usr2/fs/misc/fix_define_, to fix this. You
can run it when the FS is _not active_ (as _oper_):

  cd /usr2/proc
  /usr2/fs/misc/fix_define -t *.prc

in _test_ mode to see if there any `define` statements that need to be
fixed.  If there are, they will be displayed.  If you choose to fix
them, you can re-run the second command above without the `-t` flag to
apply the fix.  An original of each _.prc_ file that is changed is
retained with an added _.bak_ extension.

== Setting geometry values in .Xresources

A strategy for setting the `geometry` resource for an _xterm_ window
(and others with a `name` property) is:

NOTE: Most windows used by the FS are based on _xterm_, which can have
a `name` property for each case. However, windows opened by _python_
scripts do not usually have a `name` property. If it is needed, it is
possible to modify _python_ scripts to accept, and use, a geometry
parameter. Some FS _python_ based windows can already handle this.

. Adjust the position (and maybe the size) of the window to what you
want.

. Run the _xwininfo_ program from a shell prompt in an _xterm_.

. Position the cursor on the window and click.

. Copy the string output for the `-geometry` parameter, e.g,
`80x24+0+0`.

. Paste the string as the value for `geometry` resource for that
window in the _~/.Xresources_ file.

After changing or adding resources in the _~.Xresources_ file, you
will need to load them to make them active. This can done by logging
out and back in again or loading them in another way, such as using
the shell alias _rlxr_ that is available by default for _oper_ and
_prog_. The window will need to be reopened to see the effect.

NOTE: Using this method with differently named _.Xresource_ files and
reloading aliases, it is possible to have customized window layouts
for different displays and/or users.

== Opening additional windows

This section describes how to set-up your system to open additional
useful windows on your display. This could be for additional status
displays or utilities.

CAUTION: All these techniques create the potential for opening
multiple instances of a window. This might be confusing if it is not
what you intended. In particular, windows with fixed placement may
have multiple instances overlaying each other and not all be visible.

NOTE: Some programs, such as _fmset_, could cause problems if multiple
instances are running. The FS protects against that in those cases.

CAUTION: FS display programs, such _monit2_, and other _monit<x>_
programs end automatically if the FS is terminated. If you start
programs that don't end automatically with the <<Window manager>> or
<<Not using display server client>> methods below, they will continue
running after the FS is terminated.

Some windows, in particular _xterm_ windows, have a `name` property
that allows them to be associated with resources in the
_~/.Xresources_ file. This allows you to define other properties of
the window, such as placement, size, title, font, and colors. See the
<<Setting .Xresources>> sub-section below for details on this.

=== Configuring additional windows

Three possible approaches are suggested. The first includes a method
that uses keyboard _shortcuts_ to open a window with a minimal number
of key strokes, but can only be used on the local X-display console.
The others can be used on any display.

==== Window manager

This approach only works for local X-display console for an FSL__x__
system that is running the _fvwm2_ window manager (the default). There
may be equivalent options for other window managers. This approach has
two methods, which can used individually, but it is beneficial to use
both. These methods require adding lines to the user's _~/.Xresources_
file. You can see examples in the _st.default/oper/.fvwm2rc_ file.

. Keyboard shortcuts
+

This method can be particularly convenient since it only involves
holding down two modifier keys, kbd:[Control+Shift], and pressing one
other key, a quick shortcut. Using the existing example line for
_monit2_ as an example, you can add a line similar to:

+

....
Key 2 A CS Exec exec xterm -name monit2 -e monit2
....
+

In this example, the shortcut is kbd:[Control+Shift+2 ]. You should
replace the `2` with another number or lower case letter not already
in use to make a unique key combination. You could replace the `xterm
...` portion of the line with program you want to run, whether it
opens a window or not.
+

In the above example for _monit2_, the `-name monit2` option  sets the
_xterm_'s name to `monit2` string. You can replace `monit2` token with
the appropriate name.
+

The `-e monit2` option tells the _xterm_ to run the _monit2_ program
in the _xterm_. You can run any program you want in the _xterm_ or
just get your default shell by leaving off the entire `-e ...`.

. Menu selections
+

As a complement to a keyboard shortcut, you can add a menu selection
to the middle mouse button menu for the same program. This menu can
show the shortcut key sequence for the window, making it a convenient
reminder.
+

Continuing the example for _monit2_, the following line is included in
the example file for the `AddToMenu "Operator Menu" "Operator Menu"
Title` definition:
+

....
+              "Monit: status C-S-2" Exec exec xterm -name monit2 -e monit2
....
+

You can add a similar line, replacing `Monit: status` with a similar
short text description of the function being performed.  The `2` in
the `C-S-2` would be replaced with the unique character in the
shortcut. The `exec ...` would be replaced with the corresponding text
from your shortcut line.

In order to try your changes you must restart _fvwm2_: left click on
the background, select the `Restart` item, and then confirm that you
do want to restart _fvwm2_. You could also log out and back in again.

==== Using display server client

If you using the display server, there are two methods for opening
more windows. You can define windows to be opened automatically when
an instance of the client is started and you can define windows to be
opened with the `client=...` command. If you use the former for a
window, also setting up the latter will give you an easy way to
re-open a start-up client window if it is accidentally closed, without
having to exit the client and restart it.

These methods can be used on any display, not just the local X-display
console.

. Client start-up windows
+

Windows to be opened automatically when a client starts can be listed
in the _/usr2/control/stpgm.ctl_ file. For example for _monit2_, you
can add:
+

....
moni2 x xterm -name monit2 -e monit2 &
....
+

The first field is a five character name of your choosing for the
program within the FS. It must not conflict with a name of another
program within the FS. The second field must be `x` to indicate that
this is a client window. The remainder of the line, up to but not
including the final `&`, is the command to run. The last field must be
`&` to cause the program/window to be run as a background process.
This program/window will be started for each client instance and will
be automatically terminated when that client ends.
+

IMPORTANT: This method should not be used if you aren't using the
display server. While it will cause the window to be opened when the
FS is started, if the window is closed by accident, it will cause the
FS to abort.

. Windows opened with the `client=...` command.
+

This method defines the window in the _/usr2/control/clpgm.ctl_
control file.  This can be used to open a window with the `client=...`
command.

You can find an example for a `monit2` window in
_st.default/control/clpgm.ctl_:
+

....
monit2 a xterm -name monit2 -e monit2
....
+

It is similar to what is used in _/usr2/control/stpgm.ctl_ file,
except:

.. The first field is not restricted to five characters.

.. The second field is set to one of:
+
--
* `a` -- for _attached_, to have the window closed when the client exits
* `d` -- for _detached_, to have it continue after the client exits
--
+

Usually `a` is the best choice unless there is a reason to use `d`.

.. There is no final `&`.

+
--

After adding a new window to _/usr2/control/clpgm.ctl_ and starting or
restarting _fsclient_, you can open the window with:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
client=_name_
....

where _name_ is the first field on the line in _clpgm.ctl_.

==== Not using display server client

If you are _not_ running the display server, you can define SNAP
procedures to open windows. This approach can be used on any display.
Closing such windows will not cause the FS to abort.

Continuing the example of _monit2_, you could define a `monit2`
procedure in your  _station_ procedure library that contains:

....
sy=xterm -name monit2 -e monit2 &
....

CAUTION: The trailing `&` is necessary to prevent the FS from waiting
for the window to close.

Then entering `monit2` as operator input would open an instance of a
_monit2_ window.

You could also add commands like these to your `initi` procedure in
your `station` procedure library to have them open automatically when
the FS is start.

=== Setting .Xresources

The window's name can be used to access resources defined the
_~/.Xresources_ file. This allows you to set properties of the window,
such as placement, size, title, and colors.  Not all windows can have
their properties defined in this way. In particular, _xterm_ windows
can, but _python_ based windows cannot.

You can look at the example lines for _monit2_, and others, in
_st.default/oper/.Xresources_ for examples for how to define
resources for a named window. Please also see the
<<Setting geometry values in .Xresources>>
section above for a strategy to set `geometry` resources.

After adding resources in the _~/.Xresources_ file, you will need to
load them to make them active. This can done by logging out and back
in again or loading them in another way, such as using the shell alias
_rlxr_ that is available by default for _oper_ and _prog_.
