E. Himwich, J. Quick
Version 4.5 - March 2023

== Introduction

This document outlines the features and model for FS operations with
the DBBC3. It contains a section
<<Configuring the FS for use with a DBBC3>> that gives the steps for
customizing the FS for use with a DBBC3.

There are appendices, <<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>>,
<<Thread procedure>>, and <<Recorder tuning>> that describe features
that are not limited to use with the DBBC3, but are expected to mostly
be used with DBBC3s.

Support for several items that utilize the multicast data, including
the T~sys~ monitor display and multicast data logging, is built on
DBBC3 multicast unpacking software developed by Dave Horsley using his
C `struct` packing and unpacking code generator
(https://github.com/dehorsley/packgen).

== DBBC3 support features

=== DBBC3 related commands

The following SNAP commands support DBBC3s. You can access information
on the details of the commands with `help=_command_`.

* `bbc__nnn__` -- `_nnn_` from `001` to `128` -- BBC setup and monitoring

* `bbc_gain` -- Setup and monitor BBC gains

* `cont_cal` -- Setup and monitor continuous calibration configuration

+

CAUTION: The syntax of this command is different than the DBBC2
version. Most significantly, the `_samples_` parameter has been moved
to the end in the DBBC3 version. The meanings of the `_frequency_` and
`_option_` parameters are changed somewhat.

+

WARNING: So far, operation has only been tested with polarity `2`. It
is expected that other polarities will work but that has not yet been
confirmed. This affects multicast data logging, the T~sys~ display,
and use of _fivpt_ and _onoff_.

* `core3h` -- Low-level communication with Core3H boards

* `core3h_mode` -- Setup and monitoring of Core3H boards

+

This command has an unusually large number of features, which are
described in its help page. You don't need to be familiar will all the
features if you only use it as described in the
<<Setting the experiment mode configuration>> section below.

+

CAUTION: For the DDC_U personality, the Core3H board uses up to two
Ethernet outputs per board. The first output is used for the first
eight BBCs; the second, for up to an additional eight. For each output
that is active, the number of channels must be a power of two, from 1
to 16, and all channels must use either only one-bit sampling or only
two-bit sampling. If both outputs are in use for a board, they must
use the same number of channels and bits per channel.

+

An unusual feature of this command is that instead of having just the
two typical _monitor_ and _command_ forms, it has _monitor_,
_checking_, and _force_ forms. The latter is most similar to the
typical command form, but rarely used.

+

+

.Click here for more details on the command forms
[%collapsible]
====

** Monitor form

+

The monitor form is similar to the monitor form for other commands,
which usually have no parameters and show the actual hardware
configuration. That will work for `core3h_mode`, which will query all
the boards. In addition, you can query a single board by specifying
its number as the first parameter.

** Checking form

+

The checking mode is an unusual feature of this command. Like a
traditional command form, it is used with parameters to define the
board configuration, but doesn't command the board with them. Instead,
it compares them to the board's configuration to see if they agree.
Any deviations are reported as errors. The actual configuration is
reported in the same format as the monitor form. This form is used to
check the configuration.

** Force form

+

The force form is similar to the checking mode, but a literal `force`
is specified as the sixth parameter. In this case the board is
actually configured. However, this is not recommended for operational
use, except as part of determining the correct setup from a schedule,
as described in the <<Setting the boot configuration for the mode>>
subsection  below. The force form is most similar to the traditional
command form.

====

* `dbbc3` -- Low-level DBBC3 communication

* `fb_mode` -- Setting the FlexBuff recording mode -- An alias for `mk5c_mode`

* `fivept` -- Pointing measurements

* `if` -- This command was expanded to have ``_condition_``s for
whether each possible DBBC3 BBC and IF is active.

+

Usage examples can be found in the `iread` and `bread` procedures in
the default _/usr2/fs/st.default/d3fbstation.prc_ procedure library.

* `if__x__` -- `_x_` from `a` to `h` -- IF CoMo setup and monitoring

* `iftp__x__` -- `_x_` from `a` to `h` -- IF CoMo total power monitoring

* `mcast_time` -- display of multicast time information

* `onoff` -- SEFD and antenna calibration measurements

* `setup_proc` -- Conditional execution of setup procedure

+

This command does not have a specific DDBC3 aspect to it, but its use
for DBBC3s is important because the setup procedures for DBBC3 racks
are very time consuming and their execution needs to be limited. This
command is added by _drudg_ to _.snp_ files if selected by the
`setup_proc` option in _skedf.ctl_ control file. Please see the
<<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>> appendix for more details.

* `tpicd` -- TPI (multicast) recording control daemon setup

=== FS DBBC3 channel and IF labels

The DBBC3 channel labels are of the form `_nnns_`, where:

* `_nnn_` is the BBC number, `000`-`128`
* `_s_` is the side-band, `l` or `u`

For example, `032u` is BBC 32 upper side-band.

The DBBC3 IF labels are of the form `i__x__`, where:

* `_x_` is the IF, `a`-`h`

For example, `id` is IF D.

=== Configuring the DBBC3

This subsection assumes that when the DBBC3 is booted, it is set-up
according to either the "`Setting up the DBBC3 for DDC_U mode v125`"
or "`Setting up the DBBC3 for DDC_V mode v124`" document, as
appropriate.

==== Local configuration changes

This subsection covers changes that may be needed for experiments but
aren't conveyed by the schedule file, yet. Some examples are given
below.

===== Ethernet configuration

The Ethernet configuration of a Core3H board can be set in the DBBC3 boot
configuration file. It can be changed on demand with a predefined SNAP
procedure with contents such as:

IMPORTANT: If you place non-private IP address or FQDNs in your SNAP
procedures, they will be visible to anyone who can access your log
files, e.g., on a log server. Even if this does not violate your local
IT policies, it should probably be avoided. If possible, use only
private addresses.

....
core3h=1,tengbcfg eth0 ip=192.168.1.16 gateway=192.168.1.1 nm=27
core3h=1,tengbcfg eth1 ip=192.168.1.17 gateway=192.168.1.1 nm=27
core3h=1,tengbarp eth0 2 00:60:dd:44:47:60
core3h=1,tengbarp eth1 3 00:60:dd:44:47:61
core3h=1,destination 0 192.168.1.2:46220
core3h=1,destination 1 192.168.1.3:46221
....

NOTE: The above example is for one board. Settings for multiple boards
can be combined in one procedure or one procedure can call a separate
sub-procedure for each board.

TIP: A reset and sync is not required for Ethernet configuration
changes.

===== Changing thread numbers

The following command changes the thread numbers on Core3H board `1`
for _eth0_ to `3` (`196608/65536`) and _eth1_ to `4`.

....
core3h=1,regupdate vdif_header 3 196608 0x03FF0000
....

==== Setting the experiment mode configuration

Setting the experiment mode configuration is broken into two parts:
setting the Core3H board configuration which is covered in
<<Setting the Core3H board configuration>> subsection below, and
setting the rest of the configuration, which happens implicitly when
using the <<Checking the mode>> subsection farther below.

===== Setting the Core3H board configuration

Currently, the recommended method for configuring the mode for the
Core3H boards is from the DBBC3 boot configuration. This is because
that is the only safe method for syncing the boards, which is required
for changing Core3H settings that vary with the mode. A consequence is
that only one mode that changes the Core3H mode related settings can
be used per experiment.

TIP: You can change the Ethernet configuration as described above in
the <<Ethernet configuration>> subsection above after the boot as long
as you don't change any ``destination``s that are set to `none`
according to the procedure below.

NOTE: An alternate method for setting the mode configuration can be
found in the appendix <<Alternate Core3H board configuration method>>,
but at this time it not recommended. Even when it is recommended, it
requires manual steps and takes so long that schedules are still
effectively limited to one mode.

You can determine the values for your boot configuration yourself, but
this can be complicated for an arbitrary schedule unless it uses a
well known mode. The method provided in the
<<Setting the boot configuration for the mode>> subsection below can
be used to determine the correct Core3H board boot configuration for
an arbitrary mode from a schedule. It is not entirely automatic, but
will provide the needed information in a fairly straightforward
format.

====== Setting the boot configuration for the mode

This subsection assumes your boot configuration sets up the DBBC3
except for the details of the observing mode. The non-Core3H board
mode configuration is handled by the _drudg_ generated setup procedure
outside of the boot configuration, e.g., by use of the method in the
<<Checking the mode>> subsection below. The following procedure can be
use to set the boot configuration of the Core3H boards for the
schedule mode:

. _drudg_ the schedule to make the _.prc_ (and _.snp_) file. For this
example, the schedule is `r5012` for station `Kk`.

. Make sure the DBBC3 has the firmware personality and version that
you will use for the observation loaded and that _equip.ctl_ and
_dbbc3.ctl_ agree with what is in the DBBC3.

+

IMPORTANT: Although some modes can be observed with either the DDC_U
or DDC_V personalities, the setup is different. The setup for DDC_U
will not work for DDC_V, and vice-versa. This procedure will give you
a personality, and possibly version, specific setup.

. Start the FS

. Open a _new_ log. You may like to use a log file name related to the
schedule. Just be sure that each time you use this method you are
making a new log file. For example:

  log=r5012

. Open the experiment procedure library. For example:

  proc=r5012kk

. Enable `echo` output:

  echo=on

. Execute the normal Core3H setup procedure, perhaps `core3h01`, with the
`force` parameter. For example:

  core3h01=force

+

This command will generate an error when it tries to start with data
transmission without the boards being re-synced. This is normal and
benign in the current context (but not generally).

. Disable `echo` output:

  echo=off

. Close the log file by switching back to the default

  log=station

. Extract the needed information with the shell command::

+

 core3h_conf /usr2/log/r5012.log

+

The information  will be displayed as a series of lines starting with
the Core3H board number they apply to and a comma. An example of the
output for board `1`:

 1,vsi_samplerate 128000000 2
 1,splitmode on
 1,vsi_bitmask 0xcccccccc
 1,reset
 1,vdif_frame 2 8 8000 ct=off

+

TIP: If you did not open a new log before executing the Core3H setup
procedure, you can use the _last_ series of these lines. Be sure you
start from lowest numbered board used in this mode.

. Edit the displayed commands (after the comma) into the corresponding
Core3H configuration files.

+

The files are usually called __ddc_U_core3H_<N>.fila10g__ and
__ddc_V_core3H_<N>.fila10g__ depending the personality you are using
and how many Core3H boards you have, _<N>_ running from `1` to a
maximum of `8`.

+

.. For _only_ the boards with commands shown in the output:

... In the appropriate file, place the commands in the order shown,
starting just after the `inputselect` command, deleting any existing
lines with the same commands.

+

TIP: You may be able to copy-and-paste on the DBBC3 using the builtin
editor and using _putty_ to connect to the FS machine.

+

NOTE: <<note,NOTE>>[[note]]: If you need to change the VDIF payload
size, you can make the change directly in the `vdif_frame` commands
that you enter, replacing `8000` with your value. Please also read the
introductory part of the <<Handling other VDIF frame payload sizes>>
appendix for information about the error messages that changing the
payload size will cause.

... Set the `destination` lines.

+

Inspect the `core3h01` procedure to determine which masks are non-zero
for each board. They appear in the order `mask2,mask1` in the
`core3h_mode` command lines. Please be aware that the default (null)
value for `mask2` is zero; while for `mask1` it is non-zero. _drudg_
will insert an explicit zero only for `mask1`.

+

For a given board, if only `mask1` has a non-zero value, set the
`destination` for output `1` to `none`. If only `mask2` has a non-zero
value set the `destination` for output `0` to `none`. For all masks
that have a non-zero mask, make sure the corresponding outputs (`0`
for `mask1`, `1` for `mask2`) have an `__IP__:__port__` set for the
`destination`.

+

TIP: For DDC_V, you do not have to set `destination 1 none`. It is
disabled by the firmware regardless of how it is set and the FS
ignores it.

... Use `start vdif` after the `timesync` command, removing any `stop`
command that may be present.

.. For boards with no commands shown in the output:

+

+

Use `stop` after the `timesync` command, removing any `start vdif`
command that may be present.

. Reboot the DBBC3 with this configuration.

. Verify the configuration of the Core3H boards.

+

Using the same procedure library, enter:

  core3h01

+

There should be no errors reported. If any errors are reported, use
the error messages to determine what needs to be fixed in your boot
configuration files and try again, repeating until there are no
errors.

. Proceed to the <<Checking the mode>> subsection below. In addition
to checking the configuration of the Core3H boards, it configures the
non-Core3H board settings for the mode.

==== Checking the mode

Before observing, it is essential to check that the mode has been
configured correctly. This will implicitly set the non-Core3H
board aspects of the observing mode, which is also essential.

The setup procedure can be executed (without the `force` parameter) to
check that the setup is correct. Assuming the schedule procedure
library has already been opened as described in the
<<Setting the boot configuration for the mode>> subsection above (or
<<Configure Core3H boards>> subsection below), then for example use:

  setup01

CAUTION: Verify that no errors are reported when it is executed. If
there are errors, the data may not be recorded properly. This is how
the setup is checked within a schedule. This also checks that the
personality and firmware version agree with the FS control files.

TIP: There can be a lot of log output from a setup procedure, which
can make it hard to identify errors. If you use the `erchk` window,
which only lists errors, it should be easier to identify them. If you
don't already have that window setup (it is more generally useful
anyway), directions are include in the
<<Configuring the FS for use with a DBBC3>> section below.

[NOTE]
====

If you only want to check the Core3H configuration, you can use the
corresponding Core3H configuration procedure instead. For example:

    core3h01

This is not recommended for checking the mode, since it does not
configure the non-Core3H board aspects of the observing mode.

====

=== Firmware version checking

The FS checks that the DBBC3 firmware being used agrees with what is
in the FS control files, _equip.ctl_ and _dbbc3.ctl_. The personality,
__DDC_U__ or __DDC_V__, is checked first. If the personality agrees,
the version for that personality is then checked. In addition to the
error report, the string received from DBBC3 is displayed for
reference.

If one of these errors is detected, you should either load the correct
firmware/version into the DBBC3 and/or correct the FS control files.
What is appropriate depends on what you are trying to do. Ignoring, or
masking off the display of, the errors is not recommended.

The checks are made in two different situations:

* Multicast data

+

The version information is checked for each multicast reception. If
there is no multicast being received, these errors will not be
reported this way. The errors detected for the multicast data are only
reported once every twenty seconds.

+

If for some reason you wish to ignore this very persistent error
information, you can use the `tnx` to suppress it from being
displayed. It will still be logged, As an example, if you are getting
the errors `dn  -30` and `dn  -37` you can stop them from being
displayed with:

  tnx=dn,-30
  tnx=dn,-37

+

CAUTION: Suppressing the display of this error information will _not_
prevent possible loss of data and/or other error messages if the
firmware/version in the FS control files doesn't agree with what is
loaded in the DBBC3.

* Use of the `core3h_mode` command

+

The `core3h_mode` command checks the version in the two cases:

** For `core3h_mode=end` commands, with or without the `force`
parameter being used.

+

This command is the last command executed by _drudg_ generated Core3H
setup procedures. A firmware/version error will be nearly, in some
cases actually, the last error shown. That should help make it easier
to spot.

** A `core3h=__n__,...,force` command.

+

+

An error is reported for these commands in case one of them is used by
itself. This also maintains the historical precedent of checking the
version whenever the formatter is configured.

=== Control files

==== equip.ctl

For DBBC3 use, the rack type in _equip.ctl_ should be `dbbc3_ddc_u` or
`dbbc3_ddc_v` depending on the firmware that is loaded.

==== dbbc3.ctl

The DBBC3 specific control file parameters are in the _dbbc3.ctl_ control file.
An example of the contents is:

....
* Two fields: BBCs/IF (8, 12, 16 or nominal (U:16,V:8)), IFs (1-8)
  nominal 8
* DDC_U firmware version (v121 or later)
  v125
* DDC_V firmware version (v121 or later)
  v124
* mcast delay 0-99 centiseconds
  57
* setcl board
  1
* DBBC3 clock rate, >= 0, but DDDC_U/_V only supports 128
  128
....

NOTE: The use of `nominal` for BBCS/IF is recommended.

==== dbbad.ctl

The _dbbad.ctl_ file was expanded for use with DBBC3s. For the DBBC3
it can now include the multicast address, port, and the interface. If
the last three parameters are omitted, receiving multicast data is
disabled. If there are only comments in the file or the file is empty,
use of a DBBC3 will be disabled. An example of the contents (commented
out) is:

....
*dbbad.ctl example file
* one uncommented line with up to six fields:
*    host(IP address or name)
*    port(4000)
*    time-out(centiseconds)
*    multicast address
*    multicast port
*    multicast interface
* If there are no uncommented lines, DBBC(2)/DBBC3 access is disabled.
* For DBBC(2), the first three fields are required and no more can be used.
* For DBBC3, there must be either the first three fields or all six. If the
*    final three are missing, multicast reception is disabled.
* Using an IP address instead of a name avoids name server problems.
* DBBC2 example:
*  192.168.1.2 4000 500
* DBBC3 example:
*  192.168.1.2 4000 800 224.0.0.19 25000 eno2
....

==== skedf.ctl

The _skedf.ctl_ file now includes new options and expansion of some
options for DBBC3 support. The are listed in the <<drudg support>>
section below. More discussion of the two new DBBC3 related options
can be found in the <<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>> and the
<<Thread procedure>> appendices below. The details of the syntax for
all the options is available in the
_/usr2/fs/st.defaul/control/skedf.ctl_ example file.

=== Tsys monitor display

The T~sys~ monitor display is organized per IF and updates at a 1 Hz
rate. The displayed information includes: LO, time, VDIF epoch, time
difference between DBBC3 and the FS, PPS delay, T~sys~ for each
IF/Core3H board as well as BBC frequencies and T~sys~ values. By
default the display will cycle through the appropriate IFs, dwelling
for two seconds on each. Selecting other configurations is described
in the <<Commands>> subsection below.

Except for `Time`, the values are from the previous second's
multicast. Hence the T~sys~ values are from two seconds in the past.
If the system is operating normally, `Time` shows a value one second
more than in the previous second's multicast to avoid confusion with
times displayed in other windows. (Logged values of the time are the
raw received values.) This leads to the somewhat odd situation that
for a Core3H board that is not synced, with firmware version _v125_ or
higher, its `Time` value will be shown as `00:00:01` on the first day
of the current VDIF epoch.

[NOTE]
====

The `Time` value is shown with inverse video if it is not changing,
i.e., it is not advancing. The time is not available in the multicast
for firmware _v124_, so the multicast arrival time is shown. If there
is intermittent loss of multicast messages, whether due to execution
of DBBC3 commands or network issues, the `Time` value will
intermittently flash inverse video. For firmware versions _v125_ or
higher, the `Time` value will also be inverse video in some cases if
one or more of the Core3H boards is not synced.

The `Epoch` value is shown as `--` for now since the VDIF epoch is not
available yet in the multicast.

The `DBBC3-FS` time difference, in seconds, is shown in inverse video
if it is not zero (positive if the DBBC3 time is later than the FS).
It is shown as `------` for firmware _v124_.

====

The display is designed to provide useful information without operator
intervention. The operator can adjust the display as desired using the
features described in <<Commands>> subsection below.

==== Modes

The T~sys~ monitor display has three modes:

* `Rec` shows IFs with channels configured for recording
+
This is intended for normal observing.

* `Def` shows IFs with defined LO values
+
This may be useful for pointing or calibration runs.

* `All` shows all IFs

By default, if any channels are configured for recording (selected by
the bit masks in the `core3h_mode` commands), the display will go into
the `Rec` mode. If there are no channels being recorded, but there are
LOs defined for some IFs, it will go into the `Def` mode. If neither the
`Rec` nor `Def` mode is triggered, it will go into the `All` mode and
automatically change to one of other modes as appropriate. It is also
possible to change to the `All` mode from `Rec` or `Def` with a single
character (`l`) command. Another `l` will toggle the display back to the
previous mode. The current mode is displayed in the upper right hand
corner.

==== Tsys values

In the `Rec` mode, only BBC T~sys~ fields for side-bands being
recorded are populated.

In the `All` mode, if no IFs are defined and no channels are being
recorded (e.g., at FS startup), T~sys~ fields for all side-bands are
blank.

NOTE: During the transition of configuring the Core3H board between
`core3h_mode=begin` and `core3h_mode=end`, which channels are being
recorded is not fully defined. The T~sys~ display will show the most
recently selected channels (new or old) to avoid having the values
disappear momentarily if the old configuration is re-commanded.

For all displayed (non-blank) BBC T~sys~ fields, the values will be
shown if they can be calculated. If they can't be, a hint, in inverse
video, for the cause of the problem will be displayed in the
corresponding field instead. There may be more than one issue, but
only the first encountered is reported. The order is:

. `Nccal` -- continuous cal not enabled
. `N bbc` -- the BBC is not configured
. ``N lo `` -- the LO is not defined
. `Ntcal` -- no Tcal value was found

NOTE: As usual in the FS, an invalid value will be display as field
dollar signs, `$`. That usually means that a value could be
calculated, but there was a problem with the result: the result was
too large for the field, was negative when only positive values are
valid, or would have required dividing by zero.

==== Commands

The T~sys~ display accepts several one character commands:

* `*a*`-`*h*` -- show only that IF, up to the maximum defined in _dbbc3.ctl_

+

This might be useful, for example, when troubleshooting a single IF.

* `*n*` -- next IF, wrapping at the end
* `*p*` -- previous IF, wrapping at the end
* `*1*`-`*9*` -- seconds of display time for each IF (default is 2)
* `*i*` -- toggle display of IF or RF frequency for BBCs (default is RF if the LO is defined; IF, if not)

+

If no LO is defined for an IF, it will not be possible to display the
RF frequencies for the corresponding BBCs.

* `*l*` -- toggle between `All` and `Rec`*/*`Def` modes (see the <<Modes>> subsection above for defaults)
* `*0*` -- reset to all defaults
* `*?*` or `*/*` -- show help summary
*  kbd:[esc] or kbd:[control+c] -- exit
* Any other key (e.g., kbd:[space]) -- resume cycling

=== Checking DBBC3 time

The `mcast_time` command should be placed in the local `midob`
procedure to monitor the time in the DBBC3 for each scan. An error
will be reported if the multicast data is more than 20 seconds old.
For version _v124_, `mcast_time`, cannot report the time, but will
still report the `pps_delay`. For _v125_ or later, an error will be
reported if any Core3H board's time differs from the FS time.

For version _v124_ and earlier, the `dbbc3=time` command can be used.
However, the output can be difficult to interpret because the boards
may be sampled in different seconds.

NOTE: We expect that for future firmware versions, after _v125_, that
report the VDIF epoch in the multicast, `mcast_time` will report if
there is a VDIF epoch mismatch between the boards. Other checks may
also be added in the future.

=== Setting FS time

It is expected that normally the FS computer will be using NTP and the
FS time model is set to `computer` (see _misc/ntp.txt_ for more
information). If good NTP servers are available, that should give the
best time in the FS.

No suitable NTP servers may be available either because network connectivity is
poor and/or there are no local functioning NTP servers. In that case the FS
program _setcl_ can be used with DBBC3 firmware versions _v125_ and later to
set and adjust FS time (see _misc/fstime.txt_ for the details).

The implementation of _setcl_ for the DBBC3 depends on two values from the
_dbbc3.ctl_ control file:

* The delay of the multicast

+

This is the delay for when the multicast arrives after the 1 PPS. It
seems to be stable for a given system. It does seem to vary with the
number of Core3H boards and other factors we don't fully understand
yet. In tests with __DDC_U__ _v125_, we have seen delays of 57 and 75
centiseconds in systems with eight Core3H boards; 33 centiseconds, for
a system with two boards. (For __DDC_V__ _v124_ with eight boards, we
have seen about 30 centiseconds in one system and 19 in another. Since
there is no time available in the _v124_ multicast, _v124_ is not
useful for setting the FS time.)

+

The value in _dbbc3.ctl_ can be adjusted as appropriate. It should be
easy to measure it for a given system when NTP _is_ available, using
the output of the `mcast_time` command. The system will need to be
synced to NTP and the `computer` model selected in _time.ctl_. In this
case, the last value on the `mcast_time/0` line is the delay in
centiseconds; it may vary at the single centisecond level.

* The board number to use for measuring the time.

+

There can be up to eight to choose from. Board `1` will be in all systems and
should be adequate for the purpose, but which board is used can be changed in
the control file if need be.

NOTE: _setcl_ will only be able to get a useful time from the selected
board if it is synced. _setcl_ detects a lack of sync when the Core3H
board's time in the multicast is `00:00:00` or `00:00:01` on the first
day of the current VDIF epoch. As a result, twice a year for about two
seconds each, _setcl_ can incorrectly think the board is not synced.
Each run of _setcl_ tries to get the time for up to four attempts, so
even if the first two tries incorrectly show the board as unsynced, a
subsequent attempt should be okay. A lack of sync will also be shown
as `unsynced` in the `core3h_mode` command monitor output.

Using _setcl_ to set the FS time this way will only be useful to level
of stability of the delay of the multicast. Network congestion may
also cause variations, but hopefully will be minimal in situations
where this method is needed.

Even if there are significant variations, even a significant fraction
of a second (which seems unlikely), in the arrival of the multicast,
the clock model determined should be useful. Individual offset
measurements should be fairly accurate. If the clock model is
determined over a significant amount of time, a day or more, the
fractional error in the model rate should be small. The use of
`adjust` option of _setcl_ in each `midob` should keep the FS close to
the correct time. In any event, it should be good enough to run a
schedule. It should be better than any other approach without NTP.
Since the DBBC3 will be running on the correct time, small errors in
the FS time should not cause problems unless the scans are very short.

=== Multicast logging

Logging of DBBC3 multi-cast recording is controlled by the `tpicd`
command. It will automatically be enabled by _drudg_ generated setup
procedures. When logging is enabled, for each multicast message
received (nominal 1 Hz rate), the following information, shown with
their log entry labels, is logged:

* `time` -- for each Core3H board in the system
* `pps2dot` -- (`pps_delay`) in nanoseconds for each Core3H board
* `tpcont`  -- Only if continuous cal _is_ in use -- TPI counts for each BBC and IF configured for recording.
+
The counts are given in the order of cal _on_ then _off_
* `tpi`  -- Only if continuous cal is _not_ in use -- TPI counts for each BBC and IF configured for recording.
* `tsys` -- Only if continuous cal _is_ in use -- T~sys~ for each BBC and IF configured for recording and T~sys~

Even when not being logged, multicast data is normally being received.
A subset can be seen in the T~sys~ monitor display.

Multicast messages may be lost if there are network issues or if a
DBBC3 command is used. The FS will report an error (a _time-out_) once
every 20 seconds if it is not receiving multicast when `data_valid` is
`on`, i.e., during recording or e-VLBI.

IMPORTANT: Avoid use of DBBC3 commands when `data_valid` is `on`,
i.e., during a scan,  since they may cause loss of calibration data.

When `data_valid` is `off`, the FS will only report loss of multicast
messages if it does not appear to be associated with DBBC3 command
usage. We believe that there will be no "`extra`" errors caused by
DBBC3 commands. However, we cannot be sure every case has been caught.
There is some chance that there will be extra errors reported one to
three seconds after the most recent DBBC3 communication. Please report
this situation if you encounter it, so it can be fixed. It is more
convincing that a DBBC3 command is the cause if you do not normally
get multicast time-outs for other reasons.

Each time a multicast message is lost the `Time` value in the T~sys~
monitor display will not advance and will be displayed in inverse
video.

NOTE: The _plog_ utility was modified to push reduced logs with DBBC3
multicast data squeezed out by default, as it already did for RDBEs. A
subsequent revision in _plog_ causes the compressed full log to also
be pushed by default. Please see ``**plog -h**`` for more information.

=== drudg support

The DBBC3 related _drudg_ changes include:

* Support for up to eight IFs (`a`-`h`) with up to 16 dual side-band
BBCs each (overall `001`-`128`) for VEX (_.vex_) schedule files.

* Support for up to two IFs (`a` and `b`) with up to eight dual
side-band BBCs (`001`-`008`) on IF `a` and up to eight dual side-band
BBCs (`009`-`016`) on IF `b` for Mark IV (_.skd_) schedule files.

+

NOTE: For a _.skd_ schedule that would normally have a number of
channels for an IF that is not a power of two, the channels for that
IF will need to be increased to the next power of two. For example,
for  _S_/_X_: _X_-band using 10 channels, will need to be expanded to
use 16; _S_-band using six channels will need to be expanded to eight.
The expanded set of channels to be recorded can flow from the catalog,
so their use is automatic for the scheduler and the station. This is
just an example that will allow recording of all the normal data.
Other adjustments may be needed for efficient media use, data
transfer, and correlation.

* The appropriate <<DBBC3 related commands>> are used in setup
procedures.

* New _skedf.ctl_ options `setup_proc` and
`vdif_single_thread_per_file` as described in the
<<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>> and the
<<Thread procedure>> appendices.

* _drudg_ inserts a `mk5c_config` or `fb_config` procedure call into
the setup procedures when the selected recorders are Mark 5C or
FlexBuff, respectively. Please see the <<Recorder tuning>> appendix
for the details.

* The following previously DBBC2 specific _skedf.ctl_ options can also
now be used for DBBC3s:

** `cont_cal`
** `cont_cal_polarity`
** `dbbc_if_targets`
** `dbbc_bbc_target`
** `default_dbbc_if_inputs`

+

The full syntax for these options can be found in the example
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/skedf.ctl_ file.

== Configuring the FS for use with a DBBC3

This subsection  provides the steps needed to configure the FS to
support a DBBC3. You must have version FS _10.1.0_, or later,
installed before using these directions. All steps, except as noted,
are to be executed as _oper_.

. Update _equip.ctl_.

+

Change your rack type to `dbbc3_ddc_u` or `dbbc3_ddc_v`, as
appropriate.

. Update _dbbc3.ctl_.

+

Update the _dbbc3.ctl_ control file for the details of your DBBC3. The
comments in the _/usr2/fs/st.default/control/dbbc3.ctl_ file may be
helpful for determining what values to use. You can also refer to the
<<_dbbc3_ctl,dbbc3.ctl>> subsection above.

. Update _dbbad.ctl_.

+

Insert the correct IP address and port for your DBBC3 in the (only)
non-comment line. Add additional fields to increase the number to six,
using the correct information for the multicast data. Please see the
<<_dbbad_ctl,dbbad.ctl>> subsection above, or
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/dbbad.ctl_, for an example. The example's
multicast address and port may be correct. The multicast interface
used is usually your primary interface, typically _eno1_ or _eth0_.

. Update _/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_.

.. You should probably add `use_setup_proc yes`.

+

This is recommended because the setup for a DBBC3 may be long enough
to interfere with timely schedule execution. This feature is described
in the <<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>> appendix.

.. Consider whether to add the `vdif_single_thread_per_file` option
and how to set it.

+

This probably depends on what correlators you are sending your data to
and how they want the threads organized. The option and how to use it
are described in the <<Thread procedure>> appendix.

+

NOTE: If you are using a _jive5ab_ version before _v3.1.0-rc1_ and use
the single-thread-per-file option, you should remove the `scan_check`
command from your `checkmk5` and/or `checkfb` procedure as described
in the <<Thread procedure>> appendix. Upgrading to _v3.1.0-rc1_ or
later is recommended to eliminate this complication.

.. Consider adding or updating other DBBC3 related options.

+

They are:

* `cont_cal`
* `cont_cal_polarity`
* `dbbc_if_targets`
* `dbbc_bbc_target`
* `default_dbbc_if_inputs`


.. Consider copying the new or updated explanatory comments for the
new and updated parameters from the example file to your local copy.

+

+

This may help if you need to make more changes later.

. Update your `station` procedure library.

+

To make a comprehensive update will require some care and time. Both
quick start and more complete options are presented below:

.. In the short-term, with _pfmed_, you should:

... Add the `mcast_time` command to the `midob` procedure.

... If you have not already done so, add `mk5c_config` and/or
`fb_config` procedures, depending on what recorders you will be using.

+

+

Initially, these procedures can be empty, but you can add commands as
appropriate. This is described in more detail in the
<<Recorder tuning>> appendix.

.. In the long run you will need to think about how to handle updating
the `station` library in a more systematic way. There are two basic
methods as described below:

... Continue what was started with the short-term solution above and
modify your `station` library to use the DBBC3.

+

You will probably want to update many other procedures or replace them
with DBBC3 versions. The example/default DBBC3 `station` procedure
library is _/usr2/fs/st.default/proc/d3fbstation.prc_. You can place a
copy in your _/usr2/proc/_ directory with (adjusting the target file
name appropriately to avoid overwriting an existing file; use eight
characters or less for the part before `.prc`):

  cd /usr2/proc
  cp /usr2/fs/st.default/proc/d3fbstation.prc d3fbstat.prc

+

+

You can the use `pu` commands in  _pfmed_ to remove old procedures in
your `station` library and `st` to copy replacements (or additional
procedures) from `d3fbstat` (or whatever name you used). These might
include `iread` and `bread`. In other cases, you may need to make a
detailed comparison to determine how to modify the version in your
`station` library. You should use _pfmed_ commands `ed`, `emacs`, or
`vi` to edit procedures.

+

... Replace your `station` library with the DBBC3 version.

+

+

This method is particularly well suited for installing a new system
but can be useful for updating an existing system as well. If the FS
is running, `terminate` it first. Then use the commands (adjusting the
target filename in the `mv` command appropriately to avoid overwriting
an existing file; use eight characters or less for the part before
`.prc`):

  cd /usr2/proc
  mv station.prc statold.prc
  cp /usr2/fs/st.default/proc/d3fbstation.prc station.prc

+

+

+

If there are any procedures you want from your old `station` library.
You can copy them from `statold` (or whatever name you used) with the
`st` command in _pfmed_. You should use _pfmed_ commands `ed`,
`emacs`, or `vi` to edit procedures.

. Setup the DBBC3 T~sys~ display window (_monit7_)

.. Update _clpgm.ctl_.

+

Compare your local copy to the example

          cd /usr2/control
          diff clpgm.ctl /usr2/fs/st.default/control/ | less

+

and consider whether and what changes you should make. Typically, the new line
for _monit7_ would be added to your local copy.

+

TIP: If you are familiar with _vimdiff_, you may find it a more convenient way
to compare files and update your local copy. Like _vim_, _vimdiff_ may be
challenging to use until you are familiar with it. Some help is available from
web searches. Don't use it if you aren't comfortable with it.

.. Update _stpgm.ctl_.

+

+

If you are using the display server and you want to have T~sys~
display (_monit7_) start automatically with each client (including at
FS start up), add a line for it to _stpgm.ctl_. The easiest way to do
this is to make a copy of the line for _monit2_ and update for
_monit7_ (changing ``2``s to ``7``s). If you don't have a line for
_monit2_ in your _stpgm.ctl_, you can use the one in the example file,
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/stpgm.ctl_, as a guide.

. Add the `erchk` window (optional)

+

If you aren't already using the `erchk` window, its use is recommended
to make it easier to identify error messages. This can be particularly
helpful with a DBBC3 to make it easier to see any errors in the mode
configuration checking for the Core3H boards.

.. Update _/usr2/control/clpgm.ctl_.

+

The easiest way to accomplish this is to copy the corresponding line
in _/usr2/fs/st.default/control/clpgm.ctl_ to your _clpgm.ctl_.

.. Update _/usr2/control/stpgm.ctl_.

+

+

If you are using the display server and you want to have the `erchk`
window start automatically with each client (including at FS start
up), add a line for it to _stpgm.ctl_. It is recommended. The easiest
way to accomplish this is to copy the corresponding line in
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/stpgm.ctl_ to your _stpgm.ctl_.

. Update your local _rc_ files:

.. Update _~/.Xresources_.

... Add the needed lines

+

Compare your local file to the default:

  cd ~
  diff .Xresources /usr2/fs/st.default/oper | less

+

The new lines for _monit7_, and optionally `erchk` if you are adding
it, should be added to your local file.

+

[NOTE]
====

The default geometry resource in
_/usr2/fs/st.default/oper/.Xresources_ for _monit7_ handles having up
to 16 BBCs per IF. If you have fewer, you might want to adjust the
resources in your local file according to the <<geometry,Tsys monitor
display geometry values>> table below.

.Tsys monitor display geometry values
[#geometry]
[width="50%",cols="^,^"]
|=================
| BBCs/IF | width-by-height

|  8     | `24x13`
| 12     | `24x17`
| 16     | `24x21`
|=================

TIP: If you vary the number of BBCs per IF in your configuration, you
can setup the geometry for the most you use and can resize the window
to a smaller size after it is opened, if you want.

====

+

... Adjust the position of the windows.

+

+

+

Fine tuning the positions in the `geometry` values is probably best
done with the windows open while the FS is running. So you may want to
defer the tuning until you restart the FS.

+

+

You can find an effective strategy to help with setting the geometry
values for an _xterm_ window (and others with a `name` property) in
the
<<../../misc/install_reference.adoc#_setting_geometry_values_in_xresources,Setting
geometry values in .Xresources>> section of the
<<../../misc/install_reference.adoc#,Installation Reference>> document.

.. If you use the default window manager for the console, update _~/.fvwm2rc_.

+

Compare your local file to the default:

  cd ~
  diff .fvwm2rc /usr2/fs/st.default/oper | less

+

The new lines for _monit7_, and optionally `erchk` if you are adding
it, should be added to your local file.

+

NOTE: If your file uses `Style{nbsp}"monit*"{nbsp}NeverFocus` to
prevent the _monit<n>_ windows from getting the focus (it is
recommended), you will need to add the
`Style{nbsp}"monit7"{nbsp}ClickToFocus` line (or
`Style{nbsp}"monit7"{nbsp}MouseFocus`, if you prefer) in order to be
able use the T~sys~ display monitor commands on the console.


+

.. Log out and back in to put these changes into effect.

.. You should  make the corresponding changes for _prog_ while logged
in as _prog_.

. Start the FS, or restart it if it was already running.

[appendix]

== Minimizing the use of setup procedures

NOTE: This can be used for any system, not just those with DBBC3s.

Normally, the FS sets the mode for each scan (unless there is continuous
recording). If this takes too long (as is the case for the DBBC3) or makes the
equipment unstable, the _drudg_ option `use_setup_proc yes` in _skedf.ctl_ can
be used to minimize the execution of the setup procedure.

CAUTION: Not executing the setup each scan may not be robust if the
equipment sometimes loses its configuration. It is up to the individual
stations to determine whether minimizing its use is better than always
using it.

With this option enabled, _drudg_ will replace the calls to setup
procedures (e.g., `setup01`) in the _.snp_ file with, e.g.:

 setup_proc=setup01

When the FS encounters this command, it will conditionally execute the setup
procedure if either of the following is true:

* This is the first setup since the schedule was last started.
+

This will make sure the setup is run at the start and any restart of
the schedule. There should be sufficient time for the setup procedure
in these cases as long as the schedule is started as little as even
just a few minutes before the first scan.

* If there was a mode change, i.e., the name of the setup procedure changed.

+

NOTE: Mode changes within schedules is not supported yet for DBBC3s.

The `use_setup_proc` option in _skedf.ctl_ has three possible
settings:

* `yes` -- use the `setup_proc` command

* `no`  -- do not use the `setup_proc` command

* `ask` -- to prompt for `yes` or `no` for each schedule

If the option is not used, it defaults to `no`.

NOTE: The _fesh_ program was expanded to support an environment
variable, `FESH_GEO_USE_SETUP_PROC`, and a command line option, `-u`,
to set the answer for an interactive prompt for whether or not to use
`setup_proc` commands when __drudg__ing geodesy schedules. Please see
``**fesh -h**`` for more information.

Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) and Marjolein Verkouter (JIVE) for
suggesting this option. They also suggested that it may be utilized as
part of future features for additional checking and resetting of the
system.

[appendix]

== Thread procedure

NOTE: This can be used for any system with a Mark 5C or FlexBuff
recorder, not just one with a DBBC3.

When a Mark 5C or FlexBuff recorder is in use, _drudg_ can optionally
insert a `thread__suffix__` procedure in each setup procedure (where
`__suffix__` is a mode specific suffix, e.g., `01`). This can be used
to control whether the recording for a mode is multi-threaded or
single-thread-per-file. As generated by _drudg_, the contents of the
procedure is the same for every mode in the schedule. If it needs to
be different for some modes, the corresponding `thread__suffix__`
procedures can be edited.

This feature is controlled by the `vdif_single_thread_per_file` option
in the _skedf.ctl_ control file. The option only needs to be used by
stations that need to record a single-thread-per-file, at least some
of the time; the default for _jive5ab_ after being restarted is
multi-threaded. If the option is not present, no ``thread__suffix__``
procedure is inserted. If it is present, the possible settings are
(where `_command_` is `mk5` or `fb` depending on the type of
recorder):

* `yes` -- to store a single-thread-per-file, in which case, the
``thread__suffix__`` procedure contents are:

+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
_command_=datastream=clear
_command_=datastream=add:{thread}:*
_command_=datastream=reset
....

+

NOTE: As of FS version _10.2_, the `add` command was changed to
`_command_=datastream=add:ds{thread}:*`. The `ds` is passed (case
preserved) to _jive5ab_ to be used as part of the lowercase datastream
label portion of the filename. This results in filenames like
_ev024g_mc_no0009_dsds1_. The double _ds_ is intentional.

+

CAUTION: If you are using a _jive5ab_ version before _v3.1.0-rc1_ and
you select storing a single-thread-per-file, the `scan_check` command
will not work properly. You should comment it out or remove it from
your `checkfb` and/or `checkmk5` procedure. Alternately, if you only
select single-thread-per-file sometimes, you may want to edit the
procedure depending on your choice. Upgrading to _v3.1.0-rc1_ or later
is recommended to eliminate this complication.

* `no` -- for normal multi-threaded recording, in which case, the
``thread__suffix__`` procedure contents are:

+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
_command_=datastream=clear
_command_=datastream=reset
....


* `ask` -- to be prompted once per schedule for what to do

+

CAUTION: If you are using single-thread-per-file, see the *CAUTION*
about `scan_check` for the `yes` setting above.

NOTE: The _fesh_ program was expanded to support an environment
variable, `FESH_GEO_VDIF_SINGLE_THREAD_PER_FILE`, and a command line
option, `-T`, to set the answer for an interactive prompt for whether
or not to use a single-thread-per-file when __drudg__ing geodesy
schedules. Please see ``**fesh -h**`` for more information.

[appendix]

== Recorder tuning

NOTE: This can be used for any system with a Mark 5C or FlexBuff
recorder, not just one with a DBBC3.

This appendix describes changes that can be made to optimize the
configuration of your Mark 5C and/or FlexBuff recorders.

=== mk5c_config/fb_config procedure

Each mode SNAP setup procedure produced by _drudg_ for Mark 5C and
FlexBuff recorders includes a call to a `mk5c_config`/`fb_config` SNAP
procedure, depending on the type of recorder. This procedure call is
inserted immediately after the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command (and
after the optional <<Thread procedure>> call, if present). The
procedure is mode independent, i.e., the same procedure is used for
all modes.

This procedure is a local `station` library procedure to allow tuning
of the configuration of _jive5ab_ for the specifics of the recorder,
including overriding the "`default`" configuration, described next
below, given by the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command in the setup
procedure.

=== Default configuration

The `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command sends configuration information,
beyond what is set with _jive5ab_ `mode` command. This depends on
which recorder is selected in _equip.ctl_, `mk5c` or `flexbuff`, and
the total data rate. It does _not_ depend on which command is used;
`fb_mode` is just an alias for `mk5c_mode`. The commands sent also
depend on the data type, VDIF or 5B/Ethernet. All the cases are listed
below.

TIP: You can see the full details of the FS setup of the recorder by
the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command by using `*echo=on*` before the
command and `*echo=off*` afterwards.

==== FlexBuff recorder

. Setting `mtu`:

+

The `mtu` command sent to the recorder depends on the data type:

.. VDIF data

  mtu = 9000 ;

.. 5B/Ethernet data

   mtu = 6000 ;

. Setting `net_protocol`:

+

There is a variable field `_socketbuffer_` in the `net_protocol` command sent
to the recorder. Its value is independent of the data type.

+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
net_protocol = udpsnor : _socketbuffer_ : 256000000 : 4 ;
....

+

Where the _socketbuffer_ field depends on the total data rate:

*   32000000 -- data rate < 1 Gbps
*   64000000 -- 1 Gbps < data rate <= 4 Gbps
*  128000000 -- data rate > 4 Gbps

+

The _socketbuffer_ parameter is an important setting for trying to minimize
risk of packet loss when starting the recording. For (very) high data rates,
the `mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure can be used to increase the
_socketbuffer_ size to values appropriate for that. This assumes that the
FlexBuff has been tuned (especially the kernel network buffer sizes) along the
lines of the FlexBuff tuning documentation at
https://www.jive.eu/~verkout/flexbuff/flexbuf.recording.txt.

. Setting `record = nthread`:

+

There is a variable field `_nWriters_` in the `record = nthread` command sent
to the recorder. Its value is independent of the data type.

+

[subs="+quotes"]
....
record = nthread : : _nWriters_ ;
....

+

where `_nWriters_` is calculated as `max( _data_rate_ / 6 + 1, 2)` and
`_data_rate_` is the total data rate in Gbps.

==== Mark 5C recorder

. Setting `net_protocol`:

+

The `net_protocol` command sent to the recorder is independent of the data
type:

  net_protocol = : 128k : 2M : 4;

. Setting `packet`:

+

The `packet` command sent to the recorder depends on the data type:

.. VDIF data

  packet = 36 : 0 : 8032 : 0 : 0 ;

.. 5B/Ethernet data

  packet = 36 : 0 : 5008 : 0 : 0 ;

=== Overriding the defaults

You can override the commands sent by the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode`
command or add more by putting them in your local
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure. This works because
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` is called after `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode`
command (_and_ after the call to the optional <<Thread procedure>>, so
it can overridden by the same mechanism) in the setup procedure. An
example of local customization is shown in the
<<Changing net_protocol>> subsection below.

CAUTION: If you put any commands in `mk5c_config`/`fb_config` that depend on
the data type, VDIF or 5B/Ethernet, you would need to change them if there is a
change in the data type. This is not a concern for most stations.

==== Changing net_protocol

If you use different values for `net_protocol`, you can leave any field blank
that your don't need to change from what the FS has already sent. For example
to only set the _socketbuffer_ size to `64000000`, use:

....
net_protocol = : 64000000
....

[appendix]

== Alternate Core3H board configuration method

It _may_ be possible to configure the Core3H broads from the FS, but
at this time it is not considered safe to do so. This appendix
describes a method for this in case it is determined to be safe to
use. Currently, this should be viewed as a "`bleeding edge`"
engineering test method. It may be that this approach can be adapted
for use when new DBBC3 features that make it safe become available.

The fundamental issue is that it is not considered safe to re-sync the
boards except by booting the DBBC3. Most of the changes in Core3H
board configuration that depend on the observing mode require a
re-sync afterwards. Consequently, these features should only be set
from the boot configuration.

As a result, during a schedule the configuration of the Core3H boards
is not set; it is only checked. A mechanism is provided to force the
setting of the mode configuration. In principle, this can be used
before the experiment starts to place the Core3H boards in the correct
configuration without having to decode the schedule configuration and
set the Core3H boards up as part of the boot configuration. However,
this mechanism is not currently recommended.

=== Configure Core3H boards

To configure the Core3H boards for the schedule mode:

. _drudg_ the schedule to make the _.prc_ (and _.snp_) file
. Start the FS
. Open the experiment procedure library, e.g.:

  proc=r5012kk

. Execute the normal Core3H board configuration procedure, perhaps
`core3h01`, with the `force` parameter, e.g.:

  core3h01=force

+

This command will generate an error when it tries to start data
transmission without the boards being re-synced. This is normal and
can serve as a reminder that re-syncing is needed.

. Set the Core3H output ``destination``s

+

The FS does not set the ``destination``s for the Core3H boards. When
checking the configuration, it does verify that outputs that are not
expected to be recorded have their `destination` set to `none` and
outputs that are to be recorded do not. You will have to verify that
that the outputs that are being recorded have the correct
``destination`` addresses set.

+

TIP: For DDC_V, you do not have to set `destination 1 none`. It is
disabled by the firmware regardless of how it is set and the FS
ignores it.

+

You can check that the ``destination``s are set to `none` in the
correct places with, e.g.:

  core3h01

+

NOTE: This will also check the other aspects of the Core3H board
setup. Any non-`destination` related errors should also be resolved at
this time.

+

If any `destination` related errors are reported, you must correct
them. You can use commands similar to those in the example in the
<<Ethernet configuration>> subsection above, as needed. It is not
necessary to reboot the DBBC3 to fix this.

+

You can display the ``destination``s that are set for the `_n_`^th^
board with:

+

[subs="+quotes"]
....
  core3h=_n_,destination 0
  core3h=_n_,destination 1
....

+

IMPORTANT: Depending on your site's IT rules, you may need to be
careful to avoid recording public IP addresses in your experiment
logs.

. Continue to the <<Sync time>> and then the
<<Start data transmission>> subsections below for the steps to
complete the setup.

==== The configuration details

For each Core3H that is in use, the following information/commands
will be sent when using `force`, in this known-to-work order:


--

* Decimation
* Splitmode
* Bitmask
* `reset`
* `vdif_frame ...`

--

For example:

....
core3h=1,vsi_samplerate 128000000 2
core3h=1,splitmode on
core3h=1,vsi_bitmask 0xcccccccc
core3h=1,reset
core3h=1,vdif_frame 2 8 8000 ct=off
....

NOTE: The FS hard codes a VDIF frame payload size of `8000`. If a
different size is needed, please see the
<<Handling other VDIF frame payload sizes>> appendix.

=== Sync time

After the Core3H boards are configured, the operator needs to sync the
PPS, sync each Core3H, and sync the PPS a final time. In principle,
this would consist of:

....
dbbc3=pps_sync
!+1s
core3h=1,timesync
core3h=2,timesync
core3h=3,timesync
core3h=4,timesync
core3h=5,timesync
core3h=6,timesync
core3h=7,timesync
core3h=8,timesync
!+1s
dbbc3=pps_sync
....

It may be necessary to increase the delays after/before the `pps_sync`
commands to achieve reliable results. If you have fewer than eight
boards, only include the `timesync` commands for the boards you have.

It may take the boards a few tens of seconds to stabilize after the
commands. During that the period, the times reported for the boards
may vary. When the times have stabilized, continue to the
<<Start data transmission>> subsection below to complete the setup.

[IMPORTANT]
====

The above commands _may_ work for syncing. The following conditions
are required, but may not be sufficient, to verify that the sync
worked:

* There were no errors in the execution of the commands.

* All boards have the same, correct, time.

* All boards have the same, correct, VDIF epoch.

* All boards have `pps_delay` values of no more than a few tens of
nanoseconds and are not drifting. However, if a GPS 1 PPS is used as
input, some drift may be unavoidable.


The best way to check the time for version _v125_ and later is with
the `mcast_time` command. For earlier versions the `dbbc3=time`
command can be used, but the output can be difficult to interpret
because the boards may be sampled in different seconds.

The VDIF epoch and the time can be checked per board with
`core3h=__board__,time`, where `_board_` is the board number.

The `pps_delay` values can be viewed with the `mcast_time` command.

====

NOTE: All the Core3H boards in the system need to be synced, even
those not sending data. For now, the only safe way to configure a
DBBC3 is with the boot configuration. A new DBBC3 feature is being
developed to allow syncing the PPS and then syncing, in parallel, the
Core3H boards without needing to reboot.

=== Start data transmission

After the boards are synced, data transmission needs to be started or
stopped for each board, as appropriate for the mode. Assuming the
setup procedure for the mode has been used previously with the `force`
parameter as described in the <<Configure Core3H boards>> subsection
above, this can be accomplished with the command:

....
core3h_mode=end,force
....

[NOTE]
====

After the boards have been synced, data transmission can be freely started and
stopped on individual boards as needed. For example to start transmission on
board `1`, you can use:

....
core3h=1,start vdif
....

To stop transmission, use:

....
core3h=1,stop
....

CAUTION: Using these commands may make whether the board is transmitting data
inconsistent with the FS configuration and may lead to problems.

====

=== Check the mode

After the Core3H boards have been configured, you should check the
mode as described in the <<Checking the mode>> subsection above in the
main document. That step will also implicitly set the non-Core3H
configuration for the mode, which is necessary for a complete setup.

[appendix]

== Handling other VDIF frame payload sizes

The value of `8000` for the VDIF frame payload size is hard coded in
the FS for the DBBC3 and _jive5ab_ (and DBBC2/FiL10G as well).
Currently this is the correct value, but some day in the future,
different values may be needed. If that occurs before the FS is
updated to accommodate other values, this section gives a recipe for
handling it for the DBBC3 and _jive5ab_ in the meantime. It is a
little complicated, but should work. Hopefully, the FS will be updated
before it is necessary.

After you command a different VDIF payload size, the FS will complain
that the DBBC3 `vdif_frame` payload is not correct when you check the
DBBC3 configuration (i.e., using the setup procedure without the
`force` parameter), but if that is the only complaint, there should
not be a problem. The display of these errors can suppressed with the
`tnx` command.

If you are using the boot configuration method of configuring the
Core3H boards, there is a <<note,NOTE>> in the
<<Setting the boot configuration for the mode>> subsection above that
explains what to do.

This remainder of this appendix is only useful of you are using the
<<Alternate Core3H board configuration method>> appendix. As such, it
continues the examples of that appendix.

The basic strategy is to <<Determine the other settings>> needed in
the DBBC3 `vdif_frame` and _jive5ab_ `mode` commands,
<<Update the SNAP procedures>> to include the new payload size, and
then <<Command the devices>> with the new value. These are all
described in the following subsections.

=== Determine the other settings

The settings can be calculated from first principles. However, another
way to determine them is to use the `echo` output from the FS for what
would otherwise be the correct setup:

   proc=r5012kk
   echo=on
   core3h01=force
   echo=off

You will need to identify the `\#dbbcn#[core3h=_n_,vdif_frame ...` and
`\#mk5cn#[mode = VDIF_8000-...` records in the output and use the
displayed values as shown in the next subsection.

=== Update the SNAP procedures

This example uses `8200`, which is not an allowed value, as a
different payload size.

CAUTION: The examples below do not necessarily contain correct values.
They are just offered to show the form of the commands.

. Create a new SNAP procedure, perhaps called `vdif_8200`, that
contains all the other values in the `core3h=_n_,vdif_frame ...`
commands recorded in the previous section, but with the new payload
size, for example:

   dbbc3=core3h=1,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=2,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=3,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=4,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=5,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=6,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=7,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=8,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off

. Add a `jive5ab=mode=VDIF_...` command, replacing the `_8000` in the
output you recorded with, for this example, `_8200`, to the setup
procedure (`setup01` in this example) __after__ the call to
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config`. For example, add the command:

   jive5ab=mode=VDIF_8200-8192-64-2

NOTE: Not putting this command directly into your
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure allows it to be mode specific. If
you want to apply this change universally, you can put it into your
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure instead, but be wary of other
modes.

=== Command the devices

Continuing the example, enter:

   proc=r5012kk
   setup01=force
   vdif_8200

Afterwards, you need to re-sync the time as described in the
<<Sync time>> subsection and start the data transmission as
described in the <<Start data transmission>> subsection, both in the
<<Alternate Core3H board configuration method>> appendix.

IMPORTANT: The order of the last two commands above is critical to
avoid having the overall setup procedure overwrite the new payload
value for the Core3H boards.

NOTE: The reason for setting the new Core3H payload size _outside_ of
the overall setup procedure is so that when using that procedure
without `force` to check the DBBC3 configuration (and/or to configure
the non-Core3H parts of the system), the added
``core3h=__n__,vdif_frame ...`` commands won’t trigger a requirement
to re-sync the boards.
