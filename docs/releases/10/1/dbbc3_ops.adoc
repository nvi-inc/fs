= FS 10.1 DBBC3 Operations Manual
E. Himwich, J. Quick
Version 3.1 - April 2022

:toc:

== Introduction

This document outlines the features and model for FS operations with
the DBBC3. It also contains an appendix
<<Configuring the FS for use with a DBBC3>> that gives the steps for
customizing the FS for use with a DBBC3.

Support for several items that utilize the multicast data, including
the T~sys~ monitor display and multicast data logging, is built on a
well designed tool for generating multicast and unpacking software
developed, and used, by Dave Horsley (Hobart).

== DBBC3 support features

=== DBBC3 related commands

The following SNAP commands support DBBC3s. You can access information
on the details of the commands with `help=_command_`.

* `bbc__nnn__` -- `_nnn_` from `001` to `128` -- BBC setup and monitoring

* `bbc_gain` -- Setup and monitor BBC gains

* `cont_cal` -- Setup and monitor continuous calibration configuration

+

CAUTION: The syntax of this command is different than the DBBC2
version. Most significantly, the `_samples_` parameter has been moved
to the end in the DBBC3 version. The meanings of the `_frequency_` and
`_option_` parameters are changed somewhat.

+

WARNING: So far, operation has only been tested with polarity `2`. It
is expected that other polarities will work but that has not yet been
confirmed. This affects multicast data, the T~sys~ display, and use of
_fivpt_ and _onoff_.

* `core3h` -- Low-level communication with Core3H boards

* `core3h_mode` -- Setup and monitoring of Core3H boards

+

This command has an unusually large number of features, which are
described in its help page. You don't need to be familiar will all the
features if you only use it as described in the
<<Setting the experiment mode configuration>> section below.

+

CAUTION: For the DDC personality, the Core3H board uses up to two
Ethernet outputs per board. The first output is used for the first
eight BBCs; the second, for up to an additional eight. For each output
that is active, the number of channels must be a power of two, from 1
to 16 and all channels must user either only one-bit sampling or only
two-bit sampling. If both outputs are in use for a board, they must
use the same number of channels and bits per channel.

* `dbbc3` -- Low-level DBBC3 communication

* `fb_mode` -- Setting the FlexBuff recording mode -- An alias for `mk5c_mode`

* `fivept` -- Pointing measurements

* `if` -- This command was expanded to have ``_condition_``s for
whether each possible DBBC3 BBC and IF is active.

+

Usage examples can be found in the `iread` and `bread` procedures in
the default _/usr2/fs/st.default/d3fbstation.prc_ procedure library.

* `if__x__` -- `_x_` from `a` to `h` -- IF CoMo setup and monitoring

* `iftp__x__` -- `_x_` from `a` to `h` -- IF CoMo total power monitoring

* `mcast_time` -- display of multicast time information

* `onoff` -- SEFD and antenna calibration measurements

* `setup_proc` -- Conditional execution of setup procedure

+

This command does not have a specific DDBC3 aspect to it, but its use
for DBBC3s is important because the setup procedures for DBBC3 racks
are very time consuming and their execution needs to be limited. This
command is added by _drudg_ to _.snp_ files if selected by the
`setup_proc` option in _skedf.ctl control file. Please see the
<<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>> appendix for more details. 

* `tpicd` -- TPI (multicast) recording control daemon setup

=== FS DBBC3 channel and IF labels

The DBBC3 channel labels are of the form `_nnns_`, where:

* `_nnn_` is the BBC number, `000`-`128`
* `_s_` is the side-band, `l` or `u`

For example, `032u` is BBC 32 upper side-band.

The DBBC3 IF labels are of the form `i__x__`, where:

* `_x_` is the IF, `a`-`h`

For example, `id` is IF D.

=== Configuring the DBBC3

==== Initial configuration of the DBBC3

This documents assumes that when the DBBC3 is booted, it is set-up
according to either the "`Setting up the DBBC3 for DDC_U mode v125`"
or "`Setting up the DBBC3 for DDC_V mode v124`" document, as
appropriate.

==== Local configuration changes

This section covers changes that may be needed for experiments but aren't
conveyed by the schedule file, yet. Some examples are given below.

===== Ethernet configuration

The Ethernet configuration of a Core3H board can be set in the DBBC3 boot
configuration file. It can be changed on demand with a predefined SNAP
procedure with contents such as:

IMPORTANT: If you place non-private IP address or FQDNs in your SNAP
procedures, they will be visible to anyone who can access your log
files. Even if this does not violate your local IT policies, it should
probably be avoided. If possible, use only private addresses and/or
locally defined aliases.

....
core3h=1,tengbcfg eth0 ip=192.168.1.16 gateway=192.168.1.1 nm=27
core3h=1,tengbcfg eth1 ip=192.168.1.17 gateway=192.168.1.1 nm=27
core3h=1,tengbarp eth0 2 00:60:dd:44:47:60
core3h=1,tengbarp eth1 3 00:60:dd:44:47:61
core3h=1,destination 0 192.168.1.2:46220
core3h=1,destination 1 192.168.1.3:46221
....

NOTE: The above example is for one board. Settings for multiple boards
can be combined in one procedure or one procedure can call a separate
sub-procedure for each board.

TIP: A reset and sync is not required for Ethernet configuration
changes.

===== Changing thread numbers

The following command changes the thread number on _eth0_ to `3`
(`196608/65536`) and _eth1_ to `4`.

....
core3h=1,regupdate vdif_header 3 196608 0x03FF0000
....

==== Setting the experiment mode configuration

Currently, the recommended method for configuring the mode for the
Core3H boards is from the DBBC3 boot configuration. This is because
that is the only safe method for syncing the boads, which is required
for changing most Core3H settings that vary with the mode. A
consequence is that only one mode that changes the Core3H mode related
settings can be used per experiment.

TIP: You can change the Ethernet configuration as described above in
the <<Ethernet configuration>> subsection above after the boot as long
as you don't change any ``destination``s that are set to `none`.

NOTE: An alternate method for setting the mode configuration can be
found in the appendix <<Alternate Core3H board configuration method>>
below, but at this time it not recommended. Even if it were
recommended, it takes so long that schedules are still effectively
limited to one mode.

You can determine the values for your boot configuration yourself, but
this can be complicated for an arbitrary schedule unless it uses a
well known mode. A method is provided in the
<<Setting the boot configuration for the mode>> subsection below to
determine the correct Core3H board boot configuration for an arbitrary
mode from a schedule. It is not entirely automatic, but will provide
the needed information in a fairly straightforward format.

===== Setting the boot configuration for the mode

This section assumes your boot configuration sets up the DBBC3 except
for the details of the observing mode. To configure the Core3H boards
for the schedule mode:

. _drudg_ the schedule to make the _.prc_ (and _.snp_) file. For this
example, the schedule is `r5012` for station `Kk`.

. Start the FS

. Open a _new_ log. You may like to use a log file name related to the
schedule. Just be sure each time you use this method that you are
making a new log file. For example:

  log=r5012

. Open the experiment procedure library. For example:

  proc=r5012kk

. Enable `echo` output:

  echo=on

. Execute the normal Core3H setup procedure, perhaps `core3h01`, with the
`force` parameter. For example:

  core3h01=force

+

This command will generate an error when it tries to start with data
transmission without the boards being re-synced. This is normal and
benign.

. Disable `echo` output:

  echo=off

. Close the log file by switching back to the default

  log=station

. Extract the needed information:

+

#TO DO: Make a script of some sort to do this.#

 grep 'dbbcn#.core' /usr2/log/r5012.log |grep -v start|grep -o '[1-8],[^\]*'

+

The needed commands will be displayed as a series of lines starting
with the Core3H board number they apply to and a comma. An example of
the output for board 1:

 1,vsi_samplerate 128000000 2
 1,splitmode on
 1,vsi_bitmask 0xcccccccc
 1,reset
 1,vdif_frame 2 8 8000 ct=off

+

TIP: If you did not open a new log before executing the Core3H setup
procedure, you can use the _last_ series of these lines. Be sure you
start from lowest numbered board used in this mode.

+

NOTE: If you need to change the VDIF payload size, you can make the
change directly in the `vdif_frame` commands that you enter. Please
read also read the introductory part of the
<<Handling other VDIF frame payload sizes>> appendix below for
information about error messages changing the payload size will cause.

. Edit the displayed commands (after the comma) into the corresponding
Core3H config-files.

+

.. Place them in the order shown, starting just after the `inputselect`
command, deleting any existing lines with the same commands.

..  Set the `destination` lines.

+

Inspect the `core3h01` procedure to determine which masks were set for
the board. They appear in the order `mask2,mask1` in the `core3h_mode`
command lines.

+

+

If only `mask1` has non-zero value, set the `destination` for output
`1` to `none`. If only `mask2` has a value set the `destination` for
output `0` to `none`. For all masks that have a non-zero mask, make
sure the corresponding outputs (`0` for `mask1`, `1` for `mask2`) have
an `__IP__:__port__` set for the `destination`.

.. Use `start vdif` after the `timesync` command, removing an `stop`
command that nay be present.

. For boards with no commands shown in the output:

.. Use `stop` after the `timesync` command, removing any `start vdif`
command that is present.

. Reboot the DBBC3 with this configuration.

. Verify the configuration of the Core3H boards.

+

Using the same procedure library, enter:

  core3h01

+

There should be no errors reported. If any errors are reported, use
the error messages to determine what needs to be fixed in your boot
configuration files and try again, repeating until there are no
errors.

. Proceed to the <<Checking the mode>> subsection below.

==== Checking the mode

Before observing, it is essential to check that the mode has been
configured correctly.

The setup procedure can be executed (without the `force` parameter) to
check that the setup is correct. Assuming the schedule procedure
library has already been opened as described in the
<<Setting the boot configuration for the mode>> subsection above, then
for example use:

  setup01

[NOTE]
====

If you only want to check the Core3H configuration, you can use the
corresponding Core3H configuration procedure instead. For example:

    core3h01

This is not recommended for checking the mode, since it only checks
the Core3H boards.

====

Verify that no errors are reported. If there are errors, the data may
not be recorded properly. This is how the setup is checked within a
schedule. This also checks that the personality and firmware version
agree with the FS control files. 

TIP: There can be a lot of log output from a setup procedure, which
can make it hard to identify errors. If you use the `erchk` window,
which only lists errors, it should be easier to identify them. If you
don't already have that window setup (it is more generally useful
anyway), directions are include in the
<<Configuring the FS for use with a DBBC3>> appendix below.

=== Control files

==== equip.ctl

For DBBC3 use, the rack type in _equip.ctl_ should be `dbbc3_ddc_u` or
`dbbc3_ddc_v` depending on the firmware that is loaded.

==== dbbc3.ctl

The DBBC3 specific control file parameters are in the _dbbc3.ctl_ control file.
An example of the contents are:

....
* Two fields: BBCs/IF (8, 12, 16 or nominal (U:16,V:8)), IFs (1-8)
  nominal 8
* DDC_U firmware version (v121 or later)
  v125
* DDC_V firmware version (v121 or later)
  v124
* mcast delay 0-99 centiseconds
  57
* setcl board
  1
* DBBC3 clock rate, >= 0, but DDDC_U/_V only supports 128
  128
....

==== dbbad.ctl

The _dbbad.ctl_ file was expanded for use with DBBC3s. For the DBBC3
it can now include the multicast address, port, and the interface. If
the last three parameters are omitted, receiving multicast data is
disabled. If there are only comments in the file or the file is empty,
use of a DBBC3 will be disabled. An example of the contents is:

....
*dbbad.ctl example file
* one uncommented line with up to six fields:
*    host(IP address or name)
*    port(4000)
*    time-out(centiseconds)
*    multicast address
*    multicast port
*    multicast interface
* If there are no uncommented lines, DBBC(2)/DBBC3 access is disabled.
* For DBBC(2), the first three fields are required and no more can be used.
* For DBBC3, there must be either the first three fields or all six. If the
*    final three are missing, multicast reception is disabled.
* Using an IP address instead of a name avoids name server problems.
* DBBC2 example:
*  192.168.1.2 4000 500
* DBBC3 example:
*  192.168.1.2 4000 800 224.0.0.19 25000 eno2
....

==== skedf.ctl

The _skedf.ctl_ file now includes new options and expansion of some
options for DBBC3 support. The are listed in the <<drudg support>>
section. More discussion of the two new DBBC3 related options can be
found in the <<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>> and the
<<Thread procedure>> appendices below. The details of the syntax for
all the options is available in the
_/usr2/fs/st.defaul/control/skedf.ctl_ example file.

=== Tsys monitor display

The T~sys~ monitor display is organized per IF and updates at a 1 Hz
rate. The displayed information includes: LO, time, VDIF epoch, time
difference between DBBC3 and the FS, PPS delay, T~sys~ for each
IF/Core3H board as well as BBC information: frequencies and T~sys~
values. By default the display will cycle through the appropriate IFs,
dwelling two seconds on each IF. Selecting other configurations is
described in the <<Commands>> subsection below.

Except for the `Time` field, the displayed values are from the previous
second's multicast. Hence the T~sys~ values are from two seconds in the
past. If the system is operating normally, the `Time` field shows a
value one second more than in the previous second's multicast to avoid
confusion with other displayed times fields. Logged values of the time
are the raw received values.

[NOTE]
====

The `Time` value is shown with inverse video if it is not advancing.
The time is not available in the multicast for firmware _v124_, so the
multicast arrival time is shown. If there is intermittent loss of
multicast messages, whether due to execution of DBBC3 commands or
network issues, the `Time` value will intermittently flash inverse
video.

The `Epoch` value is shown as `--` for now since the VDIF epoch is not
available yet in the multicast.

The `DBBC3-FS` time difference, in seconds, is shown in inverse video
if it is not zero (positive if the DBBC3 time is later than the FS).
It is shown as `------` for firmware _v124_.

====

The display is designed to provide what should normally be the most
useful information without operator intervention. The operator can
adjust the display using the features described in <<Commands>>
subsection below for special purposes.

==== Modes

There are three modes:

* `Rec` shows IFs with channels configured for recording
+
This is intended for normal observing.

* `Def` shows IFs with defined LO values
+
This may be useful for pointing or calibration runs.

* `All` shows all IFs

By default, if any channels are configured for recording (selected by
the bit masks in the `core3h_mode` commands), the display will go into
the `Rec` mode. If there are no channels being recorded, but there are
LOs defined for some IFs, it will go into the `Def` mode. If neither the
`Rec` nor `Def` mode is triggered, it will go into the `All` mode and
automatically change to one of other modes as appropriate. It is also
possible to change to the `All` mode from `Rec` or `Dec` with a single
character (`l`) command. Another `l` will toggle the display back to the
previous mode. The current mode is displayed in the upper right hand
corner.

==== Tsys values

In the `Rec` mode, only BBC T~sys~ fields for side-bands being
recorded are populated.

In the `All` mode, if no IFs are defined and no channels are being
recorded (e.g., at FS startup), T~sys~ fields for all side-bands are
blank.

NOTE: During the transition of configuring the Core3H board between
`core3h_mode=begin` and `core3h_mode=end`, which channels are being
recorded is not fully defined. The T~sys~ display will show the most
recently selected channels (new or old) to avoid having the values
disappear momentarily if the old configuration is re-commanded.

For all displayed (non-blank) BBC T~sys~ fields, the values will be
shown if they can be calculated. If they can't be, a hint, in inverse
video, for the cause of the problem will be displayed in the
corresponding field instead. There may be more than one issue, but
only the first encountered is reported. The order is:

. `Nccal` -- continuous cal not enabled
. `N bbc` -- the BBC is not configured
. ``N lo `` -- the LO is not defined
. `Ntcal` -- no Tcal value was found

NOTE: As usual in the FS, an invalid value will be display as dollar signs:
`$$$$$`. That usually means that a value could be calculated, but there was a
problem with the result: the result was too large for the field, was negative
when only positive values are valid, or would have required dividing by zero.

==== Commands

The T~sys~ display accepts several one character commands:

* `*a*`-`*h*` -- show only that IF
* `*n*` -- next IF
* `*p*` -- previous IF
* `*1*`-`*9*` -- seconds of display time for each IF
* `*i*` -- toggle display of IF or RF frequency for BBCs
* `*l*` -- toggle between `All` and `Rec`*/*`Def` modes (unfortunately it couldn't be `*a*`)
* `*0*` -- reset to all defaults
* `*?*` or `*/*` -- show help summary
*  kbd:[esc] or kbd:[control+c] -- exit
* Any other key (e.g., kbd:[space]) -- resume cycling

=== Checking DBBC3 time

The `mcast_time` command should be placed in the local `midob`
procedure to monitor the time in the DBBC3 for each scan. An error
will be reported if the multicast data is more than 20 seconds old.
For version _v124_, `mcast_time`, cannot report the time, but will
still report the `pps_delay`. For _v125_ or later, an error will be
reported if any Core3H boards`' time differs from the FS time.

For version _v124_ and earlier, the `dbbc3=time` command can be used.
However, the output can be difficult to interpret because the boards
may be sampled in different seconds.

For future firmware versions, after _v125_, that report the VDIF epoch
in the multicast, `mcast_time` will report if there is a VDIF epoch
mismatch between the boards.  Other checks may also be added in the
future.

=== Setting FS time

It is expected that normally the FS computer is running on NTP and the FS time
model is set to `computer` (see _misc/ntp.txt_ for more information). If good
NTP servers are available, it is expected that will give the best time in the
FS.

No suitable NTP servers may be available either because network connectivity is
poor and/or there are no local functioning NTP servers. In that case the FS
program _setcl_ can be used with DBBC3 firmware versions _v125_ and later to
set and adjust FS time (see _misc/fstime.txt_ for the details).

The implementation of _setcl_ for the DBBC3 depends on two values from the
_dbbc3.ctl_ control file:

* The delay of the multicast

+

The is the delay for when the multicast arrives after the 1 PPS. It
seems to be stable for a given system. It does seem to vary with the
number of Core3H boards and other factors we don't fully understand
yet. In tests with __DDC_U__ _v125_, we have seen delays of 57 and 75
centiseconds in systems with eight Core3H boards; 33 centiseconds, for
a system with two boards. (For __DDC_V__ _v124_ with eight boards, we
have seen about 30 centiseconds in one system. Since there is no time
available in the _v124_ multicast, _v124_ is not useful for setting
the FS time.)

+

The value in _dbbc3.ctl_ can be adjusted as appropriate. It should be
easy to measure it for a given system when NTP _is_ available using
the output of the `mcast_time` command. The system will need to synced
to NTP and the `computer` model is selected in _time.ctl_. In this
case, the last value on the `mcast_time/0` line is the delay in
centiseconds; it may vary at the single centisecond level. 

* The board number to use for measuring the time.

+

There can be up to eight to choose from. Board `1` will be in all systems and
should be adequate for the purpose, but which board is used can be changed in
the control file if need be.

+

_setcl_ will not be able to get a useful time from the selected board
unless it is `synced` as shown by the `core3h_mode` command.

In any event, using _setcl_ to set the FS time this way will only be useful to
level of stability of the delay of the multicast. Network congestion may also
cause variations, but hopefully will be minimal in situations where this method
is needed.

Even if there are significant variations, even a significant fraction
of a second (which seems unlikely), in the arrival of the multicast,
the clock model determined should be useful. Individual offset
measurements should be fairly accurate. If the clock model is
determined over a significant amount of time, a day or more, the
fractional error in the model rate should be small. The use of
`adjust` option of _setcl_ in each `midob` should keep the FS close to
the correct time. In any event, it should be good enough to run a
schedule.  It should better than any other approach without NTP. Since
the DBBC3 will be running on the correct time, any additional errors
in the registration of the FS time should be small.

=== Multicast logging

Logging of DBBC3 multi-cast recording is controlled by the `tpicd`
command.  When logging is enabled, for each multicast message received
(nominal 1 Hz rate), the following information, shown with their log
entry labels, is logged:

* `time` -- for each Core3H board in the system
* `pps2dot` -- (`pps_delay`) in nanoseconds for each Core3H board
* `tpcont`  -- Only if continuous cal _is_ in use -- TPI counts for each BBC and IF configured for recording.
+
The counts are given in the order of cal _on_ then _off_
* `tpi`  -- Only if continuous cal is _not_ in use -- TPI counts for each BBC and IF configured for recording.
* `tsys` -- Only if continuous cal _is_ in use -- T~sys~ for each BBC and IF configured for recording.

Even when not being logged, multicast data is normally being received.
A subset can be seen in the Tsys monitor display.

Multicast messages may be lost if there are network issues or if a
DBBC3 command is used. The FS will report an error (a _time-out_) once
every 20 seconds if it is not receiving multicast when `data_valid` is
`on`, i.e., during recording or e-VLBI.

IMPORTANT: Avoid use of DBBC3 commands when `data_valid` is `on` since
they may cause loss of calibration data.

When `data_valid` is `off`, the FS will only report loss of multicast
messages if it does not appear to be associated with DBBC3 command
usage. We believe we that there will be no "`extra`" errors that are
caused by DBBC3 commands. However, we cannot be sure every case has
been caught. There is some chance that there will be extra errors
reported  1 to 3 seconds after the most recent DBBC3 communication.
Please report this error if you encounter it, so it can be fixed. It
is more convincing that a DBBC3 command is the cause if you do not
normally get multicast time-outs for other reasons.

Each time a multicast message is missed the `Time` value in the T~sys~
monitor display will not advance and will be displayed in inverse
video.

NOTE: The _plog_ utility was modified to push reduced logs with DBBC3
multicast data squeezed out by default, as it already did for RDBEs. A
subsequent revision in _plog_ causes the compressed full log to also
be push by default. Please see ``**plog -h**`` for more information.

=== drudg support

_drudg_ supports:

* Up to 128 dual side-band BBCs and eight IFs for VEX (_.vex_) schedule files.

* Up to 16 dual side-band BBCs (`001`-`016`) and two IFs (`a` and `b`)
for Mark IV (_.skd_) schedule files.  +

NOTE: For a schedule that would nominally have a number of channels on
an IF that is less than a power of two (for example, an _S/X_ mode),
the channels for such an IF will need to be rounded up the next power
of two. For example for _S_/_X_, the IF (_X_) with eight USB and two
LSB channels will need to be expanded to eight USB and eight LSB; the
IF (_S_) with six USB channels, to eight USB. These settings can can
flow from the catalog, so it is all automatic for the scheduler and
the station.

* The appropriate new <<DBBC3 related commands>> are used in setup
procedures.

* New _skedf.ctl_ options `setup_proc` and `vdif_single_thread_per
file` as described in the <<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>>
and the <<Thread procedure>> appendices.

* _drudg_ inserts a `mk5c_config` or `fb_config` procedure call into
the setup procedures when the selected recorders Mark 5C or FlexBuff,
respectively. Please see the <<Recorder tuning>> appendix for the
details.

* The following previously DBBC2 specific _skedf.ctl_ options that can
also now be used for DBBC3s:

** `cont_cal`
** `cont_cal_polarity`
** `dbbc_if_targets`
** `dbbc_bbc_target`
** `default_dbbc_if_inputs`

The full syntax for these options can be found in the example
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/skedf.ctl_ file.

[appendix]

== Configuring the FS for use with a DBBC3

This appendix provides the steps needed to configure the FS to support
a DBBC3. You must have version FS _10.1.0_, or later, installed. All
steps, except as noted, are to be executed as _oper_.

. Update _equip.ctl_.

+

Change your rack type to `dbbc3_ddc_u` or `dbbc3_ddc_v`, as
appropriate.

. Update _dbbc3.ctl_.

+

Update the _dbbc3.ctl_ control file for the details of your DBBC3. The
comments in the _/usr2/fs/st.default/control/dbbc3.ctl_ file may be
helpful for determining what values to use. You can also refer to the
<<_dbbc3_ctl,dbbc3.ctl>> subsection above.

. Update _dbbad.ctl_.

+

.. Update the IP address and port in your _dbbad.ctl_ control file to
point to the DBBC3 device.

.. Insert the correct address and port for your DBBC2 in the (only)
non-comment line. Add additional fields to increase the number to six,
using the correct information for the multicast data. Please see the
<<_dbbad_ctl,dbbad.ctl>> subsection above, or
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/dbbad.ctl_, for an example. The example's
multicast address and port may be correct. The multicast interface
used is usually your primary interface, typically _eno1_ or _eth0_.

. Update _/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_.

.. You should probably add `use_setup_proc yes`.

+

This is recommended because the setup for a DBBC3 may be long enough
to interfere with timely schedule execution. This feature is described
in the <<Minimizing the use of setup procedures>> appendix.

.. Consider whether to add the `vdif_single_thread_per_file` option
and how to set it.

+

This probably depends on what correlators you are sending your data to
and how they want the threads organized. The option and how to use it
are described in the <<Thread procedure>> appendix.

.. Consider adding or updating other DBBC3 related options.

+

They are:

* `cont_cal`
* `cont_cal_polarity`
* `dbbc_if_targets`
* `dbbc_bbc_target`
* `default_dbbc_if_inputs`


.. Consider copying the new or updated explanatory comments for the
new and updated parameters from the example file to your local copy.

+

+

This may help if you need to make more changes later.

. Add the `mcast_time` command to the `midob` procedure in your
`station` procedure library using _pfmed_.

. If you have not already done so, add `mk5c_config` and/or
`fb_config` procedures, depending on what recorders you will be using,
to your `station` procedure library using _pfmed_.

+ 

Initially, these procedures can be empty, but you can add commands as
appropriate. This is described in more details in the
<<Recorder tuning>> appendix.


. Setup the DBBC3 T~sys~ display window (_monit7_)

.. Update _clpgm.ctl_.

+

Compare your local copy to the example

          cd /usr2/control
          diff clpgm.ctl /usr2/fs/st.default/control/ | less

+

and consider whether and what changes you should make. Typically, the new line
for _monit7_ would be added to your local copy.

+

TIP: If you are familiar with _vimdiff_, you may find it a more convenient way
to compare files and update your local copy. Like _vim_, _vimdiff_ may be
challenging to use until you are familiar with it. Some help is available from
web searches. Don't use it if you aren't comfortable with it.

.. Update _stpgm.ctl_.

+

+

If you are using the display server and you want to have T~sys~
display (_monit7_) start automatically with each client (including at
FS start up), add a line for it to _stpgm.ctl_. The easiest way to do
this is to make a copy of the line for _monit2_ and update for
_monit7_ (changing ``2``s to ``7``s). If you don't have a line for
_monit2_ in your _stpgm.ctl_, you can use the one in the example file,
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/stpgm.ctl_, as a guide.

. Add the `erchk` window (optional)

+

If you aren't already using the `erchk` window, its use is recommended
to make it easier to identify error messages. This can be particularly
helpful with a DBBC3 to see any errors in the mode configuration
checking for the Core3H boards.

.. Update _/usr2/control/clpgm.ctl_.

+

The easiest way to accomplish this is to copy the corresponding line
in _/usr2/fs/st.default/control/clpgm.ctl_ to your _clpgm.ctl_.

.. Update _/usr2/control/stpgm.ctl_.

+

+

If you are using the display server and you want to have the `erchk`
window start automatically with each client (including at FS start
up), add a line for it to _stpgm.ctl_. It is recommended. The easiest
way to accomplish this is to copy the corresponding line in
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/stpgm.ctl_ to your _stpgm.ctl_.

. Update your local _rc_ files:

.. Update _~/.Xresources_.

... Add the needed lines

+

Compare your local file to the default:

  cd ~
  diff .Xresources /usr2/fs/st.default/oper | less

+

The new lines for _monit7_, and optionally `erchk` if you are adding
it, should be added to your local file.

+

[NOTE]
====

The default geometry resource in
_/usr2/fs/st.default/oper/.Xresources_ for _monit7_ handles having up
to 16 BBCs per IF. If you have fewer, you might want to adjust the
resources in your local file according to the <<geometry,Tsys monitor
display geometry values>> table below.

.Tsys monitor display geometry values
[#geometry]
[width="50%",cols="^,^"]
|=================
| BBCs/IF | width-by-height

|  8     | `24x13`
| 12     | `24x17`
| 16     | `24x21`
|=================

TIP: If you vary the number of BBCs per IF in your configuration, you
can setup the geometry for the most you use and can resize the window
to a smaller size after it is opened, if you want.

====

+

... Adjust the position of the windows.

+

+

+

Fine tuning the positions in the `geometry` values is probably best
done with the windows open while the FS is running. So you may want to
defer the tuning until you restart the FS.

+

+

You can find an effective strategy to help with setting the geometry
values for an _xterm_ window (and others with a `name` property) in
the
<<../../misc/install_reference.adoc#_setting_geometry_values_in_xresources,Setting
geometry values in .Xresources>> section of the
<<../../misc/install_reference.adoc#,Installation Reference>> document.

.. If you use the default window manager for the console, update _~/.fvwm2rc_.

+

Compare your local file to the default:

  cd ~
  diff .fvwm2rc /usr2/fs/st.default/oper | less

+

The new lines for _monit7_, and optionally `erchk` if you are adding
it, should be added to your local file.

+

.. Log out and back in to put these changes into effect.

.. You should  make the corresponding changes for _prog_ while logged
in as _prog_.

. Start the FS, or restart it if it was already running.

[appendix]

== Minimizing the use of setup procedures

NOTE: This can be used for any system, not just those with DBBC3s.

Normally, the FS sets the mode for each scan (unless there is continuous
recording). If this takes too long (as is the case for the DBBC3) or makes the
equipment unstable, the _drudg_ option `use_setup_proc yes` in _skedf.ctl_ can
be used to minimize the execution of the setup procedure.

WARNING: Not executing the setup each scan may not be robust if the equipment
sometimes loses it configuration. It is up to the individual stations to
determine whether minimizing its use is better than always using it.

With this is enabled, _drudg_ will replace the calls to setup
procedures (e.g., `setup01`) in the _.snp_ file with, e.g.:

 setup_proc=setup01

When the FS encounters this command, it will conditionally execute the setup
procedure if either of the following is true:

* This is the first setup since the schedule was last started.
+

This will make sure the setup is run at the start and any restart of the
schedule.

* If there was a mode change, i.e., the name of the setup procedure changed.

The `use_setup_proc` option in _skedf.ctl_ has three possible settings:

* `yes` -- use the `setup_proc` command

* `no`  -- do not use the `setup_proc` command

* `ask` -- to prompt for `yes` or `no` for each schedule

If the option is not used, it defaults to `no`.

NOTE: The _fesh_ program was expanded to support an environment
variable, `FESH_GEO_USE_SETUP_PROC`, and a command line option, `-u`,
to set the answer for an interactive prompt for the whether or not to
use `setup_proc` when __drudg__ing geodesy schedules. Please see
``**fesh -h**`` for more information.

Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) and Marjolein Verkouter (JIVE) for
suggesting this option. They also suggested that it may be utilized as
part of future features for additional checking and resetting of the
system.

[appendix]

== Thread procedure

NOTE: This can be used for any system with a Mark 5C or FlexBuff
recorder, not just one with a DBBC3.

When a Mark 5C or FlexBuff recorder is in use, _drudg_ can optionally
insert a `thread__suffix__` procedure in each setup procedure (where
`__suffix__` is a mode specific suffix, e.g., `01`). This can be used
to control whether the recordings for an experiment is multi-threaded
or single thread per file.

The contents of the procedure is same for every mode in the schedule.
This feature is controlled by the `vdif_single_thread_per_file` option
in _skedf.ctl_ control file. The option only needs to be used by
stations that need to a single thread per file. If the option is not
present, no ``thread__suffix__`` procedure is inserted.  If it is
present, the possible setting are (where `_command_` is `mk5` or `fb`
depending on the the type of recorder):

* `yes` -- to store a single thread per file, in which case, the
``thread__suffix__`` procedure contents are:

+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
_command_=datastream=clear
_command_=datastream=add:{thread}:*
_command_=datastream=reset
....

* `no` -- for normal multi-threaded recordings, in which case, the
``thread__suffix__`` procedure contents are:

+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
_command_=datastream=clear
_command_=datastream=reset
....


* `ask` -- to be prompted once per schedule for what to do

If you use the `yes` option, the `scan_check` command will not work
properly, you should comment it out or remove it from your `checkfb`
and/or `check5c` procedure. Alternately, if you use `yes` only
sometimes, you may want to edit the procedure depending on your
choice. We are looking into a mechanism to automate this. We are also
looking into how to support `scan_check` for `yes`.

NOTE: The _fesh_ program was expanded to support an environment
variable, `FESH_GEO_VDIF_SINGLE_THREAD_PER_FILE`, and a command line
option, `-T`, to set the answer for an interactive prompt for the
whether or not to use a single thread per file when __drudg__ing
geodesy schedules. Please see ``**fesh -h**`` for more information.

[appendix]

== Recorder tuning

This appendix describes changes that can be made to optimize the
configuration of the Mark 5C and FlexBuff recorders.

NOTE: This can be used for any system with a Mark 5C or FlexBuff
recorder, not just one with a DBBC3..

=== mk5c_config/fb_config procedure

Each mode SNAP setup procedure produced by _drudg_ for Mark 5C and
FlexBuff recorders includes a call to a `mk5c_config`/`fb_config` SNAP
procedure, depending on the type of recorder. This procedure call is
inserted immediately after the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command (and
after the optional <<Thread procedure>> call, if present). The
procedure is mode independent, i.e., the same procedure is used for
all modes.

This procedure is a local `station` library procedure to allow tuning
of the configuration of _jive5ab_ for the specifics of the recorder,
including overriding the "`default`" configuration, described next
below, given by the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command in the setup
procedure..

=== Default configuration

The `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command sends configuration information,
beyond what is set with `mode`,  depending on which recorder is
selected in _equip.ctl_, `mk5c` or `flexbuff`, and the total data
rate. It does _not_ depend on which command is used; `fb_mode` is just
an alias for `mk5c_mode`. The commands sent also depend on the data
type, VDIF or 5B/Ethernet. All the cases are listed below.

TIP: You can see the full details of the FS setup of the recorder by
the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode` command by using `*echo=on*` before the
command and `*echo=off*` afterwards.

==== FlexBuff recorder

. Setting `mtu`:

+

The `mtu` command sent to the recorder depends on the data type:

.. VDIF data

  mtu = 9000 ;

.. 5B/Ethernet data

   mtu = 6000 ;

. Setting `net_protocol`:

+

There is a variable field `_socketbuffer_` in the `net_protocol` command sent
to the recorder. Its value is independent of the data type.

+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
net_protocol = udpsnor : _socketbuffer_ : 256000000 : 4 ;
....

+

Where the _socketbuffer_ field depends on the total data rate:

*   32000000 -- data rate < 1 Gbps
*   64000000 -- 1 Gbps < data rate <= 4 Gbps
*  128000000 -- data rate > 4 Gbps

+

The _socketbuffer_ parameter is an important setting for trying to minimize
risk of packet loss when starting the recording. For (very) high data rates,
the `mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure can be used to increase the
_socketbuffer_ size to values appropriate for that. This assumes that the
FlexBuff has been tuned (especially the kernel network buffer sizes) along the
lines of the FlexBuff tuning documentation at
https://www.jive.eu/~verkout/flexbuff/flexbuf.recording.txt.

. Setting `record = nthread`:

+

There is a variable field `_nWriters_` in the `record = nthread` command sent
to the recorder. Its value is independent of the data type.

+

[subs="+quotes"]
....
record = nthread : _nWriters_ ;
....

+

where `_nWriters_` is calculated as `max( _data_rate_ / 6 + 1, 2)` and
`_data_rate_` is the total data rate in Gbps.

==== Mark 5C recorder

. Setting `net_protocol`:

+

The `net_protocol` command sent to the recorder is independent of the data
type:

  net_protocol = : 128k : 2M : 4;

. Setting `packet`:

+

The `packet` command sent to the recorder depends on the data type:

.. VDIF data

  packet = 36 : 0 : 8032 : 0 : 0 ;

.. 5B/Ethernet data

  packet = 36 : 0 : 5008 : 0 : 0 ;

=== Overriding the defaults

You can override the commands sent by the `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode`
command or add more by putting them in your local
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure. This works because
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` is called after `mk5c_mode`/`fb_mode`
command (_and_ after the call to the optional <<Thread procedure>>, so
it can overridden by the same mechanism) in the setup procedure. An
example of local customization is shown in the
<<Changing net_protocol>> subsection below.

CAUTION: If you put any commands in `mk5c_config`/`fb_config` that depend on
the data type, VDIF or 5B/Ethernet, you would need to change them if there is a
change in the data type. This is not a concern for most stations.

==== Changing net_protocol

If you use different values for `net_protocol`, you can leave any field blank
that your don't need to change from what the FS has already sent. For example
to only set the _socketbuffer_ size to `64000000`, use:

....
net_protocol = : 64000000
....

[appendix]

== Alternate Core3H board configuration method

It _may_ possible to configure the Core3H broads from the FS, but at
this time it is not considered safe to do so. This appendix describes
a method for this in case it ss determined to be safe to use. It may
also be that this approach can be adapted for use when new DBBC3
features that make it safe become available.

The fundamental issue is that it is not considered safe to re-sync the
boards except by booting the DBBC3. Most of the changes in Core3H
board configuration that depend on the observing mode require a
re-sync afterwards. Consequently, these features should only be set
from the boot configuration.

As a result, during a schedule, the configuration of the Core3H boards
is not set; it is only checked. A mechanism is provided to force the
setting of the mode configuration. In principle, this can be used
before the experiment starts to place the Core3H boards in the correct
configuration without having to decode the schedule configuration and
set the Core3H boards up as part of the boot configuration. However,
this mechanism is not currently recommended.

=== Configure Core3H boards

To configure the Core3H boards for the schedule mode:

. _drudg_ the schedule to make the _.prc_ (and _.snp_) file
. Start the FS
. Open the experiment procedure library, e.g.:

  proc=r5012kk

. Execute the normal Core3H board configuration procedure, perhaps
`core3h01`, with the `force` parameter, e.g.:

  core3h01=force

+

This command will generate an error when it tries to start with data
transmission without the boards being re-synced. This is normal and
can serve as a reminder that more steps are needed. Continue to the
<<Sync time>> and then the <<Start data transmission>> subsections
below for the steps to complete the setup.

==== The details

For each Core3H that is in use, the following information/commands
will be sent, in this known-to-work order:

--

* Decimation
* Splitmode
* Bitmask
* `reset`
* `vdif_frame ...`

--

For example:

....
core3h=1,vsi_samplerate 128000000 2
core3h=1,splitmode on
core3h=1,vsi_bitmask 0xcccccccc
core3h=1,reset
core3h=1,vdif_frame 2 8 8000 ct=off
....

NOTE: The FS hard codes a VDIF frame payload size of `8000`. If a
different size is needed, please see the
<<Handling other VDIF frame payload sizes>> appendix.

[NOTE]
====

The FS makes some simplifying assumptions when forming the `vdif_frame`
command. These are believed to agree with limitations in the DBBC3 and what is
needed for practical operations:

* For the number of bits per channel:
+

If any channel on a board uses two bits, it is assumed that all do.

* For the number of channels:
+

The BBCs for each board are handled as two groups: the first eight and up to an
additional eight. This splits the BBCs in agreement with the Ethernet ports
where their channels are destined. The number of channels in the group with
largest number of channels is rounded up to the next power of two, if it is not
a power of two already. The resulting, possibly rounded value, is used as the
number of channels.

====

=== Sync time

After the Core3H boards are configured, the operator needs to sync
each Core3H and sync the PPS. In principle, this would consist of:

....
core3h=1,timesync
core3h=2,timesync
core3h=3,timesync
core3h=4,timesync
core3h=5,timesync
core3h=6,timesync
core3h=7,timesync
core3h=8,timesync
!+1s
dbbc3=pps_sync
....

If you have fewer than eight boards, only include the `timesync`
commands for boards you have.

It may take the time on the boards a few tens of seconds to stabilize
after the commands.

[IMPORTANT]
====

The above commands _may_ work for syncing. The following conditions
are required, but may not be sufficient, to verify that the sync
worked:

* There were no errors in the execution of the commands.

* All boards have the same, correct, time.

* All boards have the same, correct, VDIF epoch.

* All boards have `pps_delay` values of no more than a few tens of
nanoseconds and are not drifting. However, if a GPS 1 PPS is used as
input, some drift may be unavoidable.


The best way to check the time for version _v125_ and later is with
the `mcast_time` command. For earlier versions the `dbbc3=time`
command can be used, but the output can be difficult to interpret
because the boards may be sampled in different seconds.

The VDIF epoch and the time can be checked per board with
`core3h=__board__,time`, where `_board_` is the board number.

The `pps_delay` values can be viewed with the `mcast_time` command.

====

NOTE: All the Core3H boards in the system need to be synced, even if
not sending data. After that a `pps_sync` should be issued within 20
seconds of the first `timesync`. This is not currently even possible
if more than three boards are installed since each `timesync` requires
about six seconds. In any event, for now, the only safe way to
configure a DBBC3 is with the boot configuration. A new DBBC3 feature
is being developed to allow syncing the boards in parallel and issuing
a timely `pps_sync`.

=== Start data transmission

After the boards are synced, data transmission needs to be started or
stopped for each board, as appropriate for the mode. Assuming the
setup procedure for the mode has been previously been with the `force`
parameter as described in the <<Configure Core3H boards>> subsection
above, this can be accomplished with the command:

....
core3h_mode=end,force
....

[NOTE]
====

After the boards have been synced, data transmission can be freely started and
stopped on individual boards as needed. For example to start transmission on
board `1`, you can use:

....
core3h=1,start vdif
....

To stop transmission, use:

....
core3h=1,stop
....

CAUTION: Using these commands may make whether the board is transmitting data
inconsistent with the FS configuration and may lead to problems.

====

=== Check the mode

After the Core3H boards have been configured, you should check the
mode as described in the <<Checking the mode>> subsection above in the
main document.

[appendix]

== Handling other VDIF frame payload sizes

The value of `8000` for the VDIF frame payload size is hard coded in
the FS for the DBBC3 and _jive5ab_ (and DBBC2/FiL10G as well).
Currently this is the correct value, but some day in the future,
different values may be needed. If that occurs before the FS is
updated to accommodate other values, this section gives a recipe for
handling it for the DBBC3 and _jive5ab_ in the meantime. It is a
little complicated, but should work. Hopefully, the FS will be updated
before it is necessary.

After commanding a different VDIF payload size, the FS will complain
that the DBBC3 `vdif_frame` payload is not correct when you check the
DBBC3 configuration (i.e., using the setup procedure without the
`force` parameter), but if that is the only complaint, there should
not be a problem. The display of these errors can suppressed with the
`tnx` command.

This remainder of this appendix is only useful of you are using the
<<Alternate Core3H board configuration method>> appendix above. As
such, it continues the examples of that appendix.

The basic strategy is to <<Determine the other settings>> needed in
the DBBC3 and _jive5ab_ `vdif_frame` commands,
<<Update the SNAP procedures>> to contain them, and then
<<Command the devices>> with the new values. These are all described
in the following subsections.

These subsections extend the example in the

=== Determine the other settings

The settings can be calculated from first principles. However, another
way to determine them is to use the `echo` output from the FS for what
would otherwise be the correct setup:

   proc=r5012kk
   echo=on
   core3h01=force
   echo=off

You will need to identify the `#dbbcn#core3h=_n_,vdif_frame ...` and
`#mk5cn#VDIF_8000-...` records in the output and use the values
reported in the next subsection.

=== Update the SNAP procedures

These examples use `8200`, which is not an allowed value, as an
example different payload size.

CAUTION: The examples below do not necessarily contain correct values.
They are just offered to show the form of the commands.

. You will need to create a new SNAP procedure, perhaps called
`vdif_8200`, that contains all the other values in the
`core3h=_n_,vdif_frame ...` commands recorded in the previous section,
but with the new payload size, for example:

   dbbc3=core3h=1,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=2,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=3,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=4,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=5,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=6,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=7,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off
   dbbc3=core3h=8,vdif_frame 2 8 8200 ct=off

. You can add a new `VDIF_...` command with the other recorded values,
but with the new payload size, to the setup  procedure (`setup01` in
this example) _after_ the call to `mk5c_config`/`fb_config`. For
example, add the command:

   jive5ab=VDIF_8200-8192-2-8

NOTE: Not putting this command directly into your
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure allows it to be mode specific. If
you want to apply this change universally, you can put it into your
`mk5c_config`/`fb_config` procedure instead, but be wary of other
modes.

=== Command the devices

Continuing the example, enter:

   proc=r5012kk
   core3h01=force
   vdif_8200

Afterwards, you need to re-sync the time as described in the
<<Sync time>> subsection above and start the data transmission as
described in the <<Start data transmission>> subsection above.

[NOTE]
====

The reason the setting of the VDIF payload size is _outside_ of the
Core3H board setup procedure is so that using the setup procedure
without `force` to check the DBBC3 configuration, the
`core3h=n,vdif_frame ...` commands won’t trigger a requirement to
re-sync the boards.
