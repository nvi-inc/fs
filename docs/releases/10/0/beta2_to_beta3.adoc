Version 2.2 - June 2021

//:hide-uri-scheme:
:sectnums:
:sectnumlevels: 4

:toc:
:toclevels: 4

== Introduction

The document covers updating from the _beta2_ pre-release to the
_beta3_ pre-release.

For instructions for other upgrade paths, see the
<<10.0.0.adoc#_other_update_documents,Other update documents>>
sub-section of the
<<10.0.0.adoc#,FS 10.0.0 Update Notes>> document.

== Upgrading from 10.0.0-beta2 to 10.0.0-beta3

You must have already upgraded to _10.0.0-beta2_ according to the
<<beta2.adoc#,FS 10.0.0-beta2 Update Notes>> document or the 
<<beta1_to_beta2.adoc#,FS 10.0.0-beta1 to FS 10.0.0-beta2 Update Notes>>
before
installing this update.

=== Fetch and make 10.0.0-beta3

NOTE: If you are using FSL7 or other old distribution that may not be
compatible with the latest update of the server, you may still be able
to use the FS without the server by removing it from the _make_
process. Please follow the steps in <<noserver, not building the
display server>> below.

If you are using _git_, as is recommended, then as _prog_
execute:

             cd /usr2/fs-git
             git fetch
             git checkout -q 10.0.0-beta3
             make clean rmdoto rmexe
             make >& /dev/null
             make -s

No output from the last command indicates a successful _make_.

=== Additional steps

. If you use RDBEs in your back-end and want to use the _rdbemsg_
utility to send operations messages, please customize your
_/usr2/control/rdbemsg.ctl_ control file by adding the `name` line to
the file if you haven't already.  Full instructions are provided in
the, revised, <<beta2.adoc#_update_rdbemsg_ctl,Update rdbemsg.ctl>>
sub-step in the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document.


. If you use the _fesh_ script there is one required change (listed
first below) and a few optional changes that depend on your situation:

.. If not already set, specify a directory for _.skd_ files in the
`$schedules` block of the _/usr2/fs/skedf.ctl_ control file. You can
use any value you want, but to be backward compatible with the
previous behavior of _fesh_ it must be _/usr2/sched_.

.. Likewise, directories should be specified in the `$snap` and `$proc`
blocks of _/usr2/contol/skedf.ctl_. You can use any
values you want, but typically they should be set to _/usr2/sched_ and
_/usr2/proc_, respectively, to agree with the FS.

.. The _fesh_ script uses _cddis_ as the default data center. You can
specify a different data center by setting the `FESH_DATA_CENTER`
environment variable. Available data centers for geodesy are _bkg_,
_cddis_, and _opar_; for astronomy, _vlbeer_.
+

TIP: For FSL8 and other old Linux distributions, access to _cddis_ may
not be possible, due to out-of-date certificates. If you are in that
situation, _bkg_ or _opar_ may be suitable alternatives.

.. The _fesh_ script uses FTP-SSL as the default access method for the
_cddis_ data center. For this case, you an avoid having to answer a
prompt for your email address each time you run _fesh_  by setting your
email address in the `FESH_EMAIL` environment variable.
+

TIP: The FTP-SSL method may not work from behind some firewalls.  If
it doesn't work for you, either use a different data center (see
above) or use HTTPS for _cddis_ (see below).

.. You can change the access method for _cddis_ to HTTPS, by setting
the `FESH_CDDIS_METHOD` environment variable to `https`.
+

NOTE: Using HTTPS requires an _EarthData_ login and setting it in
your _.netrc_ file.  If you donâ€™t have an _EarthData_ login, you
should be able to get one by selecting `REGISTER` at:
https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/.

+

Please see `*fesh -h*` for more information on using these features.
A more complete description of the changes is in <<fesh,fesh changes>>
below.

. If you have a local (station) `lo` command, you will need to update
it (or replace it, see the next paragraph) to get full support for
rack types that were not in your previous FS9 version and implement
the new capability described in <<logrxg,logging _.rxg_ files>>
below.
+

To reduce the maintenance burden of updating your local `lo` (and, if
you have it, an `lo_config`) command in the future, you should
consider switching to use the newly provided `lo` command
<<lohooks,hooks>> described below. This approach may not be suitable
for all stations, but if it will work for your station, it should
reduce, and in most cases eliminate, the need to update your local
software when the FS `lo` command changes in the future.

. Update _/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_. Due to an <<skedf.ctl,error>> in
the example _/usr2/fs/st.defaut/control/skedf.ctl_ file, most stations
probably incorrectly show the `lo_config` keyword as `if_config` in
their local version. Please check your local copy and update any
occurrences, even in comments,  of `if_config` to `lo_config`.

=== Details of FS changes

. [[new_ifdbb]] Add _new_ifdbb_ script for (RDBE) VGOS stations. This script is
intended as a tool to allow stations, and schedule writers, a way
to update schedules for changes in the _ifdbb_ procedure used by
VGOS stations, particularly those with RDBE back-ends. For RDBE
stations, the attenuation used in the signal chain, which is set
by the schedule, depends on the observing mode being used and the
conditions at the station. The provides a way to incorporate
needed changes into schedules. If the script is run without other
command line arguments, it will output "`help`" information.

. [[fesh]] Update and expand _fesh_ (includes closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/36[#36],
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/37[#37],
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/65[#65], and partially closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/38[#38]).

.. _fesh_ now supports encrypted access to _cddis_ using FTP-SSL and
HTTPS (closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/36[#36]). This
allows use of _cddis_ after non-SSL FTP access was disabled there at
the end of October 2020. FTP-SSL is the default method.

+

For FTP-SSL, it is recommended that the
`FESH_EMAIL` environment variable be set to avoid having to provide
an email address as the _anonymous_ FTP-SSL password for each
invocation.

+

TIP: The FTP-SSL method may not work from behind some firewalls.
If it doesn't work for you, you can either use HTTPS for _cddis_  or
use a different data center (see below).

+

CAUTION: The use of FTP-SSL by _cddis_ may be deprecated in the future.

+

Using HTTPS can be activated for _cddis_ by setting the
`FESH_CDDIS_METHOD` environment variable to `https`.

+

NOTE: Using HTTPS for _cddis_ requires an _EarthData_ login and
setting it in your _.netrc_ file.  If you donâ€™t have an _EarthData_
login, you should be able to get one by selecting `REGISTER` at:
https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/.

+

TIP: For FSL8 and other old Linux distributions, access to _cddis_ may
not be possible, due to out-of-date certificates. If you are in that
situation, _bkg_ or _opar_ may be suitable alternatives.

.. _fesh_ now supports _bkg_, _cddis_, _opar_, and _vlbeer_ data
centers (closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/37[#37]). The
data center can be selected with the `FESH_DATA_CENTER` environment
variable or the `-D` command line option. The default data center is
_cddis_. For _vlbeer_ only _.vex_ files are supported; for the others
only, _.skd_.  Running _drudg_ automatically is not supported for
_vlbeer_.

.. _fesh_ now respects the _/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_ control file
(closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/65[#65]). Previously
_fesh_ assumed that the directory for _.skd_ files was _/usr2/sched/_
regardless of what was in the `$schedules` block of
_/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_. This only worked if the directory specified
was _/usr2/sched_ or was the working directory (i.e., not specified or
`.`). This prevented use with different directories, such as
_/usr2/exper_, for _.skd_ files.  Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for
reporting this.

.. _fesh_ now provides support for _drudg_ optional prompts for
geodesy schedules (partially closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/38[#38]). It is assumed that for
geodesy the answers to these questions for a station do not vary. This
feature is intended to allow stations that observe both astronomy and
geodesy schedules to use _fesh_ for geodesy schedules.  The
environment variables `FESH_GEO_TPICD`, `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL`,
`FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL_POLARITY`, and `FESH_GEO_VSI_ALIGN` or the command
line options `-tcpa` can be used to supply answers to the
corresponding _drudg_ prompts.

+

IMPORTANT: _Let the user beware._ This feature must be used with
extreme care.  The answers that are specified must correspond exactly
to the questions that _drudg_ will ask. If they don't correspond
correctly, _drudg_ may produce subtly incorrect output with no obvious
indication of a problem. The _fesh_ script does what consistency
checking it can, e.g., if `FESH_CONT_CAL` is specified as `off`, no
answer can be supplied for `FESH_CONT_CAL_POLARITY` since that
question will not be asked. It is important to verify that correct
output is being produced.

+

IMPORTANT: The feature will not work for schedules that have more than
mode. It is extremely rare for geodesy schedules to have more than one
mode, but it is possible.

.. Use of an environment variable, `LIST_DIR`, was added to specify the
directory for _drudg_ listings. If not set, the `.skd` file directory
is used.

.. Use of an environment variable, `NETRC_DIR`, was added to specify a
directory other than the user's home directory (__~__) for the `.netrc`
file used with HTTPS access for _cddis_.  The same variable is used by
the _plog_ script for the same purpose.

+

Normally, the _.netrc_  file would be in the user's home directory.
However, some systems have security policies that forbid that. This
variable provides a way to have the _.netrc_ file in a different
directory.

+

.. The user name for the unencrypted FTP access to _bkg_, _opar_, and
_vlbeer_, is explicitly set to _ftp_ to avoid potential conflicts with
other accounts specified in _~/.netrc_ (this is not redirected by
`NETRC_DIR`).

.. Several new command line options were added:

... `-y` to override the year directory accessed for a geodesy data
center (the default is the current year).
+

This is particularly useful for getting schedules for the next year.

... `-t` to trigger also downloading the _.txt_ file associated with a
geodesy schedule.`

... `-m` to override the month directory accessed for _vlbeer_ (the
default is the current month).
+

This is particularly useful for getting schedules for a future month.

... `-H` to disable the default use of the _.latest_ sub-directory of
the month directory for _vlbeer_.

... `-D` to override the data center if the `FESH_DATA_CENTER`
environment variable is set, or change the data center from the
default if it is not set.

... `-s` to override the station code if the `STATION` environment
variable is set, or set it if it is not set.

+

Please see `*fesh -h*` for more information on using these features.

. [[stationrdbemsg]] Remove hard coding of the station name in _rdbemsg_ (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/62[#62]). The station name is now
set in _rdbemsg.ctlr_ control file. Thanks to Chevo Terraza (MGO) for
reporting this.

. [[fsserver]] Improve _fsserver_ (includes closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/69[#69],
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/78[#78], and re-closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/76[#76]).

.. _spub_/_ssub_ occasionally froze (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/69[#69]). This may
have been caused be the byte order being wrong in buffered stream `cb`
We believe that this issue is fixed. The situation is still being
monitored.  Please report any instance of this problem that occurs. It
happens very rarely so it is challenging to get enough usage to verify
that it is not happening.  If it does happen, restarting the client
has been a successful strategy for recovery.

.. Fixed `clean` function in _Makefile_.
.. Fixed _sspub_ to support more than 2^32^ messages.
.. Modified the build so that it will work for FSL8 (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/78[#78], and re-closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/76[#76]). Thanks to Jon Quick
(HartRAO) for special effort on this including adding documentation
to assist with future upgrades of _nng_.
 
. [[gnplt]] Improve _gnplt_ (closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/72[#72] and https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/73[#73]).

.. _gnplt_ now updates the date in updated _.rxg_ files (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/72[#72]).  The original
developer, Tomas Gille (NVI), did very good work developing this
second version of _gnplt_, but ran out of time in his internship and
was unable to include this minor but important feature. Thanks to
Beppe Maccaferri (Medicina) for reporting this.

.. _gnplt_ now works on FSL8 (Lenny) again (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/73[#73]).  Some
improvements in _beta1_ made it fail for FSL8.

. [[helpfiles]] Improve `help` command (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/75[#75]).

.. The `help` file for the `ddbc` command was expanded to also
describe the `dbbc2` and `dbbc3` commands and now includes a
description of the output for multi-line responses for all of these
commands (closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/75[#75]). The
`help` command now works for the `dbbc2` and `dbbc3` commands.

.. The `help` file for the `fila10g` command was expanded to also
support the `fila10g2` command. The `help` command now works for the
`fila10g2` command.

.. Restore `help` command for DBBC3 commands. The selection of DBBC3
specific commands was lost in the merge of the VGOS and main branches.
It is now restored.

. [[noserver]] Add option to not build the display server into the FS
(partially closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/76[#76]).  The
latest version of the server may not _make_ successfully on some
older Linux distributions such as FSL7. To help users in that
situation, an option was added to disable inclusion of the server by
setting the `FS_DISPLAY_SERVER_NO_MAKE` environment variable before
__make__-ing the FS. Follow the steps below to remove the server.

.. As _prog_:

+

* If you use _tcsh_, add the following to _~/.login_:

  setenv FS_DISPLAY_SERVER_NO_MAKE 1

+

* If you use _bash_, add the following to _~/.profile_:

  export FS_DISPLAY_SERVER_NO_MAKE=1

+

.. Logout of and then back into the _prog_ account.

.. _make_ the FS.

.. It is also necessary to make sure that users running the FS do
not have the `FS_DISPLAY_SERVER` environment variable set.

... As  _oper_:

.... Delete or comment out any lines in the _~/.login_
file (if using _tcsh_) or _~/.profile_ (if using _bash_) setting
the variable.

.... Logout and back in before attempting to run the FS.

... Repeat the above steps as _prog_.

. [[gpl]] Add GPL to files. The GPL was missing from the _include/*.i_
files.

. [[updatenotes]] Improve update notes (includes closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/71[#71]).

.. Modify steps for updating to a specific commit after _beta2_ to
use the latest commit instead. As well as being
simpler, this is part of a new approach to try to keep the update
notes current with the latest commit. It is important
to be aware that the latest commit is not a version
intended for operations. We make every effort to make sure it is
bug free, but problems may occur. Since it represents the
"`bleeding edge`" of development, features may not be as stable nor
use as reliable as released (tagged) versions.

.. Add the inclusion of the new _rdbemsg_ utility as a change. It was
not mentioned for _beta1_ or _beta2_.

.. Add missing _rdbemsg.ctl_ customization.

.. Reorganized as _.adoc_ files in the _docs/_ sub-directory (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/71[#71]).
+

All of the _.adoc_ files are viewable as HTML, and are hierarchically
indexed, at https://nvi-inc.github.io/fs/. The first update notes
available in HTML are for <<beta2.adoc#,10.0.0-beta2>>.  Hopefully,
this change will make the update notes easier to read and navigate.
Among other improvements, there are clickable links to other sections
within documents as well as to sections in other related documents.
<<../../../misc/font_conventions.adoc#,FS Document Font conventions>>
similar to the traditional printed FS manuals are used. A document
describing <<../../../misc/env_vars.adoc#,FS environment variable>>
use was added.

.. Improve structure and correct some errors from original _.txt_ version.
.. Some typo/wording fixes.

. [[logrxg]] Add _.rxg_ file logging to `lo` command.

.. Summary information logging.
+

When an LO is configured (or monitored) with the `lo` command, a
summary of information from the matching _.rxg_ file is displayed and
logged.  Details of the format are available with `help=lo`.  This is
intended to give the operator feedback that the correct version of the
_.rxg_ file is in use. Thanks to Alastair Gunn (Jodrell Bank) for
suggesting this.

.. Full logging of _.rxg_ file non-comment lines.
+

When an LO is configured with the `lo` command, the contents of the
corresponding _.rxg_ file are logged, but not displayed. This only
occurs if this is the first time this _.rxg_ file matched an LO being
configured since the most recent opening of the current log. Each
logged line starts with `:rxg_file,` followed by the name of the
_.rxg_ file, and then the values from a single non-comment line in the
file. The lines are logged in the order from the _.rxg_ file. This is
intended to provide historical information about the values being used
in FS calculations.

. [[lohooks]] Add hooks for local LO control to `lo` and `lo_config`
commands.

.. Hook in `lo` command.
+

While the FS has an option for any built-in command to have a local
version, having such a local overriding command can create a
maintenance burden if the FS command is updated.  Some commands very
rarely change, but others change fairly often. The more often they
change, the more maintenance burden there is.  Unfortunately the `lo`
command changes fairly often.
+

To address this issue, a hook has been added to the FS version of the
`lo` command to run _antcn_ in a particular local mode to configure an
LO when it is commanded.  This is triggered with the environment
variable `FS_LO_ANTCN_MODE`.  The details of the interface are
available in the `Comments` section show with `help=lo`. This may not
be a suitable solution in all situations.  If you have (or need) a
local `lo` command you can continue to use it (or implement one), but
it will need to be updated to get new capabilities such as new racks
and <<logrxg,logging .rxg files>> when they come along.
+

NOTE: This change does not currently provide a way to display LO
configuration information read back from the device.

.. Hook in `lo_config` command.
+

The _drudg_ program provides a means to include the calling of a
`lo_config` command at the end of each IF setup procedure it
generates. This is intended to provide stations that implement
commanding the LO configuration to device(s) with a way to do it in
one step for a mode as to opposed individually with
`lo=...` commands. It can also be used to implement command of the
LO setup for a mode instead of with the `lo` command to reduce (but not
eliminate) the maintenance burden that is  needed if a local `lo`
command is used.  See the example
_/usr2/fs/st.default/control/skedf.ctl_ file for how to trigger
``drudg``'s use of this command (also see the related
<<skedf.ctl,skedf.ctl fix>> in this sub-section.
+

Until now the `lo_config` command has been a station only command,
i.e., it had to implemented as a local command. With this update, there
is now a built-in command that can used for this functionality, if it
is suitable. If it is not suitable, the local command can still be
used or implemented.
+

By default the built-in `lo_config` command is a no-op. However,
it has a hook that can used to run _antcn_ in a particular local mode
to implement configuring the LOs.  This is triggered with the
environment variable `FS_LO_CONFIG_ ANTCN_MODE`. The details of the
interface are available in the `Comments` section shown with
`help=lo_config`.

. [[skedf.ctl]] Fix example _/usr2/fs/st.default/control.skedf.ctl_
(closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/81[#81]). The example
_sked.ctl_ file incorrectly identified the `lo_config` keyword as
`if_config`. This has been fixed. It is recommended that you check
and, if needed update your local copy in
_/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_ appropriately, including the comments.

. [[saterrors]] Fix ignoring _antcn_ errors in the `satellite` and
`satoff` commands. (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/82[#82]). This bug caused errors
from _antcn_ to be ignored for _only_ these commands. It has been
fixed.

=== Details of drudg changes

. [[head]] Fix crash if `$HEAD` is the last block in a `.skd` file. Fixed bug in _reads.f_.

. [[mask]] Fix crash if error in mask (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/74[#74]). A particular error in
the mask format intermittently excited an uninitialized variable bug.
Thanks to Beppe Maccaferri (Medicina) for reporting this. He
discovered it while testing with _r1971.skd_ (which was not an
experiment that included Medicina).

. [[drudgsource]] Clean-up source.

.. Remove references to passes, headstacks, and S2.

.. Add the GPL to files it was missing from.

.. Unify source between __sked__ and the FS.
