= FS Mark 6 Support
Version 0.6 - November 2021

:sectnums:
:toc:

== Introduction

This document describes Mark 6 support in FS 10.0.0 when the Mark6 is
used with the _cplane_/_dplane_ control programs. Use of a Mark 6 with
_jive5ab_ is supported in the FS as a _FlexBuff_ recorder and is not
covered here.

The support for a Mark 6 with _cplane_/_dplane_ does not provide the
complete command set and functionality usually provided by the FS for
a recorder.  However, it is sufficient for normal FS for VGOS
observations if the schedule procedure library is provided by a
specially crafted _.skd_ schedule file (see the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#broadband,broad band support>> item of the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#_drudg_changes_relative_to_the_main_branch,drudg
changes relative to the main branch>> sub-section of the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#,Changes from FS9>> document for more details).

== FS Mark 6 support features

The Mark 6 features included are:
 
=== Up to two Mark 6 are supported

If two Mark 6s are available, one or the other can be used for
recording if only that one has a control file that defines a recorder.
This gives an effective way to switch back and forth between two
recorders without having to change the commands used. This uses the
parallel execution form of commands, i.e., without a trailing device
letter in the command names, as described below in
<<Parallel command execution>>, but with only one recorder defined.

If more than one Mark 6 is used, it would typically be for parallel
recording of different data streams. This has not been tested.

It should possible in the future to record sequentially, but this will
require modifications to dynamically change which recorder is
considered active.

|=================

=== Parallel command execution

Parallel execution of commands for multiple Mark 6s is supported
(currently the only other device that has this is RDBE racks).
Currently the only parallel Mark 6 command is `mk6`.

* Multiple instances of devices are identified by the letters,
`a`,`b`, etc. In this case, `a` through `b`.

* Commands that support parallel operation always start with
`_device_` mnemonic, in this case `mk6`. If a letter for the device,
e.g., `a`, is appended to the command, e.g., `mk6a`, the command
operates only on that device.  If no letter is appended, the command
operates on all active instances of the device.

* By default all available devices are active.  Which devices are
active can be changed with an `active___device__s` command, in this
case `active_mk6s`.

* Which devices are available are defined by which have control files
that have non-comment entries. In others words, a device is not
available if its control file is commented out.

* If any errors occur during communication with the devices, they are
all reported. All but the last are reported by the command itself. The
last is returned and reported as the final status of the command.

* Logged responses from the devices may occur in what appears to be
random order. Although communication with devices is initiated in
sequential order, variations in response time can cause the responses
to arrive in a different order. The responses are logged in the order
received.

=== Low level Mark 6 communication command

The `mk6` command can be used to communicate directly with an
individual Mark 6 or all active Mark 6s in parallel, as described in
the <<Parallel command execution>> sub-section above. A semi-colon is
appended to any string being sent if it not the last character
already. A newline (`0xa`) is also appended. For full details of the Mark 6
command set, please see the documentation:

https://www.haystack.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/docs_Mark6_Mark6_command_set-Release-1.0.pdf

=== Communication control programs

* Each Mark 6 has its own control program, _mk6ca_ and _mk6cb_.

* Each control program uses a similarly named control file,
_mk6ca.ctl_ and _mk6cb.ctl_.
+

These files have one non-comment line, containing three fields:

. The IP or hostname of the device
+

NOTE: For systems where IP addresses and/or hostnames are sensitive
information, it is recommend to use an alias, such _rdbea_ that has
its IP address set in _/etc/hosts_.

. The control port for the device.
+

Usually `14242`.

. The time-out for the device in centiseconds.
+

A value of `100` (one second) is usually suitable for local devices.

=== mk6in external program

A script _mk6in_ is provided as a diagnostic utility to report the
data rate being received at the Mark 6 inputs.  The script is
available in _misc/mk6in_. It should be installed in the Mark 6
_~oper/bin_ directory, as _oper_, and made executable:

 chmod a+x ~/bin/mk6in

A CentOS version is available in _misc/mk6in.centos_ (you will need to
name it _mk6in_ when you put it in _~oper/bin_ on the Mark 6).

To use the script as a FS command, add a `mk6in` SNAP procedure to the
_station_ library, containing:

  sy=popen -n mk6in 'ssh oper\@mark6a bin/mk6in 2>&1' &

An example is available in _st.default/rdbestation.prc_.  You can
substitute the IP, nodename, alias (from _/etc/hosts_) for your Mark 6
in place of the `mark6a` in the above command.  You can have different
SNAP procedure versions, maybe `mk6ina` and `mk6inb` for two different
Mark 6s.

To use this seamlessly, it will be necessary to copy the FS _oper_ SSH
public key to the Mark 6 _oper_ account. For example, as _oper_ on the
FS machine, you could use:

  ssh-copy-id oper@mark6a

Answer the prompts appropriately.
