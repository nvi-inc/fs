= FS 10.0 DBBC3 Support
Version 0.3 - January 2022

:sectnums:
:toc:

== Introduction

This document covers DBBC3 support in FS _10.0.0_. This support does
not provide the complete command set and functionality usually
provided by the FS for a rack. However, it is sufficient for normal FS
for VGOS observations if the schedule procedure library is provided by
a specially crafted _.skd_ schedule file (see the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#broadband,broad band support>> item of the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#_drudg_changes_relative_to_the_main_branch,drudg
changes relative to the main branch>> sub-section of the
<<changes_10.0.0.adoc#,Changes from FS9>> document for more details).

== FS DBBC3 support features

The following table gives the IFs and BBCs available based on the
number of BBCs per IF and the number of IFs.

|=================

=== FS DBBC3 channel labels

FS DBBC3 channels labels are constructed as `_nnns_`, where:

* `_nnn_` is the BBC number `000`-`128`
* `_s_` is the side-band, `l`, `u`, etc.

For example, `032u` is BBC 32, upper side-band.

=== Polarization designations

Polarizations used in _.rxg_ files and the `LO` command are `lcp` or
`rcp` (in _onoff_ output `l` or `r`) regardless of the actual
polarization pair in use. The pairs are: H and V; L and R; and X and
Y. This will be fixed eventually (see
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/42[#42]). For now, since there
are are at most two polarizations per receiver, the designations
follow the _alphabetical_ (in English) rule. This is, what matters is
the alphabetical order of the first letter of the names in a
polarization pair. The correction interpretation is determined by
context. Thus:

* `l` (or `lcp`) can represent horizontal linear polarization ("`h`"),
LCP ("`l`"), or "`x`"

* `r` (or `rcp`) can represent vertical linear polarization ("`v`") ,
RCP ("`r`"), or "`y`"

=== Low level dbbc3 command

Direct low-level device communication is available with the `dbbc3`
command. Multi-line responses are supported, please use `*help=dbbc3*`
for more information.

=== BBC bbcNNN commands

Commands are provided for command and monitoring of individual BBCs.
The commands have the form `bbc__NNN__`, where `_NNN_` runs `001` to
`128`. Please use `*help=bbcnnn*` for more information. Only a
subset of these commands may be available depending on the DBBC3
configuration. See the <<table1,table>> in the <<FS DBBC3 support features>>
section above for the BBCs available per configuration.

=== IF conditioning module ifX command

Commands are provided for command and monitoring of individual IF
conditioning modules.  The commands are of the form `if__X__`, where
`_X_` runs from `a` to `h`. Please use `*help=ifx*` for more
information. Only a subset of these commands may be available
depending on the DBBC3 configuration. See the <<table1,table>> in the
<<FS DBBC3 support features>> section above for the IFs available per
configuration.

=== IF total power iftpX command

Commands are provided for monitoring of total power data for
individual IF conditioning modules.  The commands are of the form
`iftp__X__`, where `_X_` runs from `a` to `h`. Please use
`*help=iftpx*` for more information. Only a subset of these commands
may be available depending on the DBBC3 configuration.  See the
<<table1,table>> in the <<FS DBBC3 support features>> section above
for the IFs available per configuration.

=== BBC gain control bbc_gain command

The `bbc_gain` command can be used to control DBBC3 BBC gain control
for individual or all BBCs. Please use `*help=bbc_gain*` for more
information.

=== Continuous calibration control cont_cal command

The use of continuous calibration control, can be controlled and
monitored using the `cont_cal` command. This includes whether
continuous calibration is turned on and the polarity of the signal.
Please use `*help=cont_cal*` for more information.

=== Tsys measurements

Tsys measurements are supported for both continuous and non-continuous
calibration. The support is basically the same as it is for the DBBC2.
DBBC3 BBCs can be selected individual or as `evenl`, `evenu`, `oddl`,
and `oddl`.  IFs can be selected individually. All detectors can be
selected using `all`. The `formbbc` and `formif` selections are not
supported yet.

Due to the heavy communication load required for this, measuring Tsys
in schedules is not practical (it may be usable if the number of BBCs
involved is very small). As a result, effective Tsys measurements for
observations won't be possible until there is support for multicast
data.

=== Pointing and SEFD measurements

The `fivept` and `onoff` command support continuous and non-continuous
calibration radiometer using individual DBBC3 detectors. For `onff`,
the detectors can be selected as individually or as `allbbc`, `all`,
`allu`, `alll`, or `alli`. The `formbbc` and `formif` selections are
not supported yet.

NOTE: See `*help=fivept*` and `*help=onoff*` for more information on
using those commands.

=== Example procedure libraries

Temporary example DBBC3 station (_dbbc3st.prc_) and pointing
(_dbbc3po.prc_) are available in _st.default/proc_.

=== New line in equip.ctl

The _equip.ctl_ file has a new line at the end for the DBBC3. Its
fields are:

. DBBC3 firmware version: `v121` or greater
. BBCs per IF: `8`, `12`, or `16`
. IFs: `1`-`8`

You can see _st.default/control/equip.ctl_ for an example.

=== Communication control program

Communication with DBBC3 is handled by the _dbbcn_ control program.
This implies that a DBBC3 can only be used simultaneously with a DBBC2
if it is accessed as the _secondary_ DBBC2 with the `dbbc2` and
`fila10g2` commands and _fmset_ for time setting.
