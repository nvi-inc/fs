== Introduction

The document covers updating from the _beta3_ pre-release to the
FS _10.0.0_.

For instructions for other upgrade paths, see the
<<10.0.0.adoc#_other_update_documents,Other update documents>>
sub-section of the
<<10.0.0.adoc#,FS 10.0.0 Update Notes>> document.

== Upgrading from 10.0.0-beta3 to 10.0.0

You must have already upgraded to _10.0.0-beta3_ according to the
<<beta3.adoc#,FS 10.0.0-beta3 Update Notes>> document or the
<<beta2_to_beta3.adoc#,FS 10.0.0-beta2 to FS 10.0.0-beta3 Update Notes>>
before
installing this update.

=== Fetch and make 10.0.0

If you are using _git_, as is recommended, then as _prog_
execute:

             cd /usr2/fs-git
             git fetch
             git checkout -q 10.0.0
             make clean rmdoto rmexe
             make >& /dev/null
             make -s

No output from the last command indicates a successful _make_.

=== Additional steps

. If you have a station `lo_config` command, you should make sure it
has been updated as described in the
<<10.0.0.adoc#_update_local_lolo_config_commands,Update local lo/lo config commands>>
sub-step of the
<<10.0.0.adoc#_update_station_programs,Update station programs>>
step in the <<10.0.0.adoc#,FS 10.0.0 Update Notes>> document. Although
updating the `lo` command was mentioned for the update to
__10.0.0-beta3__, updating the `lo_config` command was omitted from
some versions of the instructions.

. If you use _metserver_ as a local program and you updated to FS10
from a VGOS branch, you may want to update to the new version. It
includes several improvements, see the <<metserver,metserver>> change
(in the <<FS changes>> sub-section below) for more details. See
_st.default/st-0.0.0/metserver/INSTALL_ for the installation
instructions. 

. If you original updated to FS10 from a VGOS branch version, and
haven't already, you should remove use of the deprecated _be_client_
and _mcicn_ scripts with the more general _s_client_ script.
+

You can find instances of the deprecated scripts commands, using,
e.g., for _be_client_:

   cd /usr2/proc
   grep be_client *.prc

+

You can use `less` to identify the SNAP procedures in each file that
uses the script. Use _pfmed_ to make the changes.
+

Information about using _s_client_ can be found using `*help=sy*`.

. If you initially installed a beta version from scratch (and in
particular on FSL10) and are using _bash_ as your shell, you can
change your configuration to prevent the _cd_ command from changing
the `login shell` window title, if you would like. Doing so will keep
the title of this dedicated-use window consistent with the
documentation.
+

To make this change, add the line:

  login_sh*allowTitleOps: false
+

to the `login shell` stanzas of your _~oper/.Xresources_ and
_~prog/.Xresources_ files. See _st.default/~oper/.Xresources_ for an
example. You will need to log-out and log back in again to make the
change fully active.

. If they are not already, convert the contents of your _aquir_
control files to lowercase. This is usually necessary since the FS is
now case sensitive. However, you _could_ arrange your control files
and procedure libraries to use uppercase if you want. That would be an
unusual situation. For the typical situation, you can convert as
_oper_, for example, with:
+

CAUTION: These commands will change all the uppercase in the file(s)
to lowercase, including in comments. The change for the comments
should be benign. While it might not be what is desired for some of
the comments, it will enforce lowercase for lines that are currently
commented out, but may be uncommented in the future. You can always
use an alternative method of conversion to retain uppercase in
comments only in places where you want it.

   cd /usr2/control
   /usr2/fs/misc/to_lower ctlpo.ctl
+

You can repeat this for other _aquir_ control files you may have. The
_to_lower_ script can process multiple files given on the command
line. It will make a back-up of original files with an added _.bak_
extension. It will not overwrite any existing _.bak_ file. It stops if
any error is encountered.
+

CAUTION: Each _aquir_ control file has its own horizon mask that is
separate from the one in _location.ctl_.

=== Review changes

Please see the <<Changes since 10.0.0-beta3>> section below
for details of the changes since that pre-release.

== Changes since 10.0.0-beta3

There are separate sub-sections with summaries of changes in the FS
and _drudg_.

Clickable links such as
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/36[#36] connect to specific issues
reported at https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues.

A complete history of changes can be found using the `git log` command
from within the FS _git_ archive directory, usually _/usr2/fs-git_.

=== FS changes

. Improvements to _msg_:

.. Add checking in _msg_ for the FS being active just before writing to
the log (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/86[#86]).
+

This allows `msg` to send its output to the log if it is started
before the FS. Previously, it had to be started after the FS. Thanks
to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for suggesting this.

.. Add feature to _msg_ to allow switching from "`manual start`" to
"`auto-start`" (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/87[#87]).
+

By design, _msg_ only allowed "`auto-start`" to be entered from the
`Ready` form. If the connection to the FS computer is lost (killing
_msg_) while waiting for "`auto-start`" to complete, it was difficult
to re-enter without sending a new `Ready` message. To help with this
an `Auto-start` button was added to "`manual start`".  When _msg_ is
restarted, the user can go to the `Start` form and use the
`Auto-start` button to re-enter "`auto-start`". The log must already
be open to the experiment log when _msg_ restarted for this to work.
Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for suggesting this.

. Add the `.rxg` file LO values to the `lo/rxg` output lines.
+

This change is intended to make it clearer which `.rxg` file is use,
particularly if there are files with both `fixed` and `range` LO
specifications that could match (`fixed` has priority).

. Change default _.Xresource_ files to prevent overwriting of `login
shell` window title by _bash_.
+

This maintains consistent window naming for agreement with existing
documentation. This only affects _bash_ users.

. Improve DBBC2 `if__x__` command help files.

.. The fact that the IF target level is not command as the default was added.

.. The range for IF filter 3 was corrected to 1536-2048.

.. The description of the scaling of the IF power measurements was
brought up to date.

. Add missing help file for `active_mk6s`.

. Make improvements to update instructions:

.. [[makeinc]] Add `make clean rmdoto rmexe` command after `git
checkout` in incremental update notes.
+

For incremental updates it is necessary to clean the old compiled
code. This is due to _drudg_ not participating in the new _Makefile_
scheme, but it is generally cleaner too. Thanks to Carlo Migoni
(Sardinia) for reporting this.

.. Add update instructions to covert the contents of _aquir_ control
files to lower case.
+

This is necessary and was omitted in all the _beta_ update
instructions. The distributed example _aquir_ control files were
converted to lowercase. Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for reporting
this.

.. Add suggestions for how to set-up for opening additional windows
interactively in the
<<../../misc/install_reference.adoc#_opening_additional_windows,Opening additional windows>>
section of the
<<../../misc/install_reference.adoc#,Installation reference>> document.

.. Add switching to _s_client_ to the update notes for former VGOS
branch users.

.. [[metserver]] Add update instructions for switching to the new
_metserver_.  It has several new features for former users of the old
VGOS branch versions:

... A new command line argument to disable errors messages for specific
sensors if they are broken.

... Support for `FS_SERIAL_CLOCAL` _make_ time environment variable for
FSL9 and later.

... Improved reporting of errors when opening serial devices.

... Reduction in the threshold for old data being declared _stale_ to
10 seconds, which is more than sufficient.

. Fix an issue with _git_ on FSL8 causing the repo to appear "`dirty`"
after _root_ does a `make install`.

. Switch back to using internal version information for `fesh` and
`plog`.
+

Using the FS version could make it look like the programs have changed
when they hadn't. Using the FS version was a change in _beta2_.

. Improve start-up error message from _fserr_ if an error message line
is too long in _fsser.ctl_ or _sterr.ctl_.
+

Previously, it reported the error as being in the following `""` line.

. Add `mci-code` and `mci-parameter` options to _rdbemsg.ctl_.
+

These options allow overriding of the station code in the MCI log and
which positional parameter to extract from the data lines,
respectively. If these lines are not specified, the values default to
the station code and `2`, respectively. These are needed for the
prototype MCI nodes at GGAO and Westford. GGAO requires `gg` for the
code and `3` for the parameter position.

. Update default control files:

** _equip.ctl_ -- Change default second recorded to `none`.
** _stpgm.ctl_ -- Change five character name of _monit2_ to `moni2`.
** _rdbemsg.ctl_ -- Add example `mci-code` and `mci-parameter` lines.

. Add `save` to all _fslb/novas.f_ routines.
+

This is defensive in case local variable are changed to being
automatic. The NOVAS routines seem to require static variables.

. Add missing GPL to _wish_ scripts.

=== drudg changes

. Fix the GB shown in _drudg_ listings (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/88[#88]).
+

The values had been incorrectly scaled by 1000/1024 since _beta1_.
This was fixed. This issue was introduced in the merge of the VGOS
branch, which also had this issue. This did not have much consequence
for Mark 6 users, but it could lead to selecting the wrong size module
for Mark 5 usage.  Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for reporting this.
+

The size of the GB being recorded in `mk6=record=...` commands had the
same issue dating back to the VGOS branch as well. This was also
fixed. This error had no impact since the value is only used by the
recorder to determine whether the disk module has enough room for the
recording and the Mark 6 modules were not being used near their
capacity limit.

. Correct the name of the setup procedure used for `BB` racks to
always be `setupbb` regardless of the recorder selected (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/57[#57]).
+

This makes schedules more useful with other recorders, particularly
`none` (which is used for single dish tests).

. Allow the `$PARAMS` block to occur after other blocks in _.skd_
files.
+

Previously it has to be the first block.

. Restore summary listings for staggered start (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/94[#94]).
+

This bug was apparently introduced in _beta1_. It was apparently
broken in the merge of _9.13.2_ (where it worked) and the VGOS branch.
Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for reporting this.
