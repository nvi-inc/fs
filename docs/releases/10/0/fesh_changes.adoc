= FS 10.0.0 fesh Changes
Version 0.4 - February 2021

== Introduction

This document covers the extensive changes to _fesh_ for FS _10.0.0_.

== fesh changes

Please use `*fesh -h*` for more information on using these features.

=== Encrypted access to cddis

_fesh_ now supports encrypted access to _cddis_ using FTP-SSL and
HTTPS (closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/36[#36]).

This allows use of _cddis_ after non-SSL FTP access was disabled there
at the end of October 2020. FTP-SSL is the default method.

For FTP-SSL, it is recommended that the `FESH_EMAIL` environment
variable be set to avoid having to provide an email address as the
_anonymous_ FTP-SSL password for each invocation.

TIP: The FTP-SSL method may not work from behind some firewalls.
If it doesn't work for you, you can either use HTTPS for _cddis_  or
use a different data center (see <<Additional data centers>> below).

CAUTION: The use of FTP-SSL by _cddis_ may be deprecated in the future.

Using HTTPS can be activated for _cddis_ by setting the
`FESH_CDDIS_METHOD` environment variable to `https`.

NOTE: Using HTTPS for _cddis_ requires an _EarthData_ login and
setting it in your _.netrc_ file.  If you donâ€™t have an _EarthData_
login, you should be able to get one by selecting `REGISTER` at:
https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/.

=== Additional data centers

_fesh_ now supports _bkg_, _cddis_, _opar_, and _vlbeer_ data
centers (closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/37[#37]).

The data center can be selected with the `FESH_DATA_CENTER`
environment variable or the `-D` command line option. The default data
center is _cddis_. For _vlbeer_ only _.vex_ files are supported; for
the others, only _.skd_.  Running _drudg_ automatically is not
supported for _vlbeer_.

TIP: For FSL8 and other old Linux distributions, access to _cddis_ may
not be possible, due to out-of-date certificates (for both FTP-SSL or
HTTPS). If you are in that situation, _bkg_ or _opar_ may be suitable
alternatives.

=== Respect skedf.ctl

_fesh_ now respects the _/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_ control file
(closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/65[#65]).

Previously _fesh_ assumed that the directory for _.skd_ files was
_/usr2/sched/_ regardless of what was in the `$schedules` block of
_/usr2/control/skedf.ctl_. This only worked if the directory specified
was _/usr2/sched_ or was the working directory (i.e., not specified or
`.`). This prevented use with different directories, such as
_/usr2/exper_, for _.skd_ files.  Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for
reporting this.

=== Optional drudg prompts for geodesy

_fesh_ now provides support for _drudg_ optional prompts for
geodesy schedules (partially closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/38[#38]).

It is assumed that for geodesy the answers to these questions for a
station do not vary. This feature is intended to allow stations that
observe both astronomy and geodesy schedules to use _fesh_ to _drudg_
geodesy schedules.  The environment variables `FESH_GEO_TPICD`,
`FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL`, `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL_POLARITY`, and
`FESH_GEO_VSI_ALIGN` or the command line options `-tcpa` can be used
to supply answers to the corresponding _drudg_ prompts.

IMPORTANT: _Let the user beware._ This feature must be used with
extreme care.  The answers that are specified must correspond exactly
to the questions that _drudg_ will ask. If they don't correspond
correctly, _drudg_ may produce subtly incorrect output with no obvious
indication of a problem. The _fesh_ script does what consistency
checking it can, e.g., if `FESH_CONT_CAL` is specified as `off`, no
answer can be supplied for `FESH_CONT_CAL_POLARITY` since that
question will not be asked. It is important to verify that correct
output is being produced.

IMPORTANT: The feature will not work for schedules that have more than
one mode. It is extremely rare for geodesy schedules to have more than
one mode, but it is possible.

=== New environment variable LIST_DIR

Use of an environment variable, `LIST_DIR`, was added to specify the
directory for _drudg_ listings. If not set, the `.skd` file directory is used.

=== New environment variable NETRC_DIR

Use of an environment variable, `NETRC_DIR`, was added to specify a
directory other than the user's home directory (__~__) for the
`.netrc` file used with HTTPS access for _cddis_. The same variable is
used by the _plog_ script for the same purpose.

NOTE: Normally, the _.netrc_  file would be in the user's home directory.
However, some systems have security policies that forbid that. This
variable provides a way to have the _.netrc_ file in a different
directory, perhaps _/usr2/control_.

=== User name ftp used for FTP

The user name for the unencrypted FTP access to _bkg_, _opar_, and
_vlbeer_, is explicitly set to _ftp_ to avoid potential conflicts with
other accounts specified in _~/.netrc_.

NOTE: For FTP, use of `NETRC_DIR` does not affect which _.netrc_ file
is used, i.e., FTP in _fesh_ always uses _~/.netrc_.

=== New command line options

Several new command line options were added:

* `-y` to override the year directory accessed for a geodesy data
center (the default is the current year).
+

This is particularly useful for getting schedules for the next year.

* `-x` to trigger also downloading the _.txt_ file associated with a
geodesy schedule.`

* `-m` to override the month directory accessed for _vlbeer_ (the
default is the current month).
+

This is particularly useful for getting schedules for a future month.

* `-H` to disable the default use of the _.latest_ sub-directory of
the month directory for _vlbeer_.

* `-D` to override the data center if the `FESH_DATA_CENTER`
environment variable is set, or change the data center from the
default if it is not set.

* `-s` to override the station code if the `STATION` environment
variable is set, or set it if it is not set.

* `-a` to set or override the `FESH_GEO_VSI_ALIGN` value
* `-c` to set or override the `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL` value
* `-p` to set or override the `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL_POLARITY` value
* `-t` to set or override the `FESH_GEO_TPICD` value

=== Typo in error message fixed

A typo in the error message for when the schedule is already
downloaded was fixed (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/34[#34]). Thanks to Morgan
Goodrich (KPGO) for reporting this.

=== Internal version print-out was changed.

The format of the version print-out was changed.
