== Introduction

This document covers changes in the _fsserver_ for FS _10.0.0_.

== fsserver changes

These changes introduce new functionality to _fsserver_, as well as
simplify some use cases.

=== Use one websocket

The first major change is that the server now only needs to use one
socket when using _websockets_ -- addresses that start with `ws://`
(closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/29[#29]).

The new default base URL for all _fsserver_ streams and control
channels is now:

    ws://127.0.0.1:7083

(70 83 are decimal ASCII encoding of `F` and `S`.)

This can be changed by editing `FS_SERVER_URL_BASE` in
_include/params.h_; however, we will likely introduce command-line
flag and/or environment variable to set this in the future.
 
This should be safe to expose on the network (rather than just the
loop-back), but users may wish to use HTTPS proxying to provide some
authentication/authorisation.

This was enabled by factoring out functionality _spub_ into a
reusable "`buffered stream`" library, which has been incorporated
into _fsserver_. All the behaviour of streams are now managed
within the _fsserver_ process rather than an external _spub_
instance.

=== FS log stream

The second major change of this patch is the addition of the FS log
to the streams available from the server (closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/25[#25]).

Previously only the
"`display`" was available, which has a reduced time-stamp format and
filters some output. The log stream is available at

    FS_SERVER_URL_BASE/log

that is, by default

    ws://127.0.0.1:7083/log

=== Server continues running after FS termination

A third change is that the server now continues running after the
FS is terminated.

This allows clients to detect the FS termination and prevents a socket
conflict if the FS is terminated and restarted in quick succession.
The only user visible impact will be a slight delay if the FS is
restarted quickly after termination while the old session is finishing
up.

IMPORTANT: After an FS upgrade or changing FS runtime environment
variable values, it's necessary to either shutdown the server
(`*fsserver stop*`) or reboot the system before re-starting the FS.

IMPORTANT: If you run the FS under a different account than _oper_
(perhaps _prog_), _fsserver_ will remain a process of that account
until it is stopped. Even if the FS is restarted, it will continue to
run from the other account because _fsserver_ will be its parent. This
may result in unexpected behavior, such as _oper_ not owning new files
that are created and _ssh_ commands run from the FS having a default
identity other than _oper_. To avoid this, it is recommended to either
reboot or run `*fsserver stop*` after using the FS from an account
other than _oper_.

=== Server accepts SNAP commands

Fourth, the server can now accept snap commands to be sent to FS,
e.g.:

   fsserver fs snap "terminate"

This allows clients to interact with the FS directly through
fsserver rather than needing access to _inject_snap_.

No filtering or authorisation is implemented on this command channel,
so it effectively allows complete command execution privileges in the
FS context to anyone with access to the socket.  Note this is also
true for _inject_snap_ on a standard system. If a station wishes to
limit local access they can use _iptables_/_nftables_, or use the
server in UNIX socket mode and use file system permissions. Stations
that would like to enable remote access should implement their own
authentication/authorisation that suits their needs, e.g. SSH port
forwarding or HTTPS proxying.

=== Updated nng library

The fifth and final major change is that this patch also upgrades the
included messaging library _nng_ to version _1.3.0_. This brings with
it some performance improvements and bug fixes.

Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for special effort fixing the _Makefile_
for FSL8. He also added documentation file
_third_party/src/README_nng.make_ to assist with future upgrades of
_nng_.

=== Bug fixes

. Fixed _spub_/_ssub_ occasionally freezing (tentatively closing
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/69[#69]).
+

This may have been caused be the byte order being wrong in buffered
stream `cb`. The situation is still being monitored.  Please report
any instance of this problem that occurs. It happens very rarely so it
is challenging to get enough usage to verify that it is not happening
anymore.  If it does happen, restarting the client has been a
successful strategy for recovery.

. Fixed `clean` function in _Makefile_.

. Fixed _sspub_ to support more than 2^32^ messages.
