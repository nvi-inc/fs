== Introduction

The document covers updating from the _beta1_ pre-release to the
_beta2_ pre-release. Like all beta pre-releases, _beta2_ is not
intended to operations.

== Upgrading from 10.0.0-beta1 to 10.0.0-beta2

You must have already upgraded to the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvi-inc/fs/259e203330fff145dba5ea6b2f48c8bcd23b4333/misc/fs10.0.0up.txt[10.0.0-beta1]
release before installing this update.

If you made it through the _beta1_ update despite the errors and
omissions in the instructions (now corrected, we apologize), the
update instructions from the _beta1_ are much simpler. The overall
method is described here:

=== Fetch and make the release

If you are using _git_ as is recommended, then as _prog_
execute:

             cd /usr2/fs-git
             git fetch
             git checkout -q 10.0.0-beta2
             make -s

=== Recompile station code

Recompile your station code. If your _/usr2/st/Makefile_ is
set-up in the usual way, then as _prog_ execute:

             cd /usr2/st
             make rmdoto rmexe all

=== Reboot

IMPORTANT: Reboot the computer.  This is necessary to allocate FS, and possibly station, shared
memory for the new version.

=== Login in as oper

The remaining steps assume you are logged in as _oper_.

=== Update control files

. If your old version before the _beta1_ update was _9.12.12_, you
should review the sub-steps in the <<beta2.adoc#\_update_control_files,Update control files>>
step of the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document. In particular,
there were two changes from the _beta1_ version to review:

.. In the _beta1_ version of the now _corrected_ <<beta2.adoc#\_copy_control_files,Copy control files>>
sub-step in the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document, your _clpgm.ctl_ file may have been
needlessly overwritten. We think is is unlikely that any local
customizations were lost, but if they were, we apologize. Hopefully
you made a backup before trying the update. In which case, you should
be able to recover the file from the backup. Otherwise, hopefully the
changes needed are small. Additional changes to _clpgm.ctl_ are
covered farther below.

.. In the _beta1_ version of the now _corrected_ <<beta2.adoc#\_update_equip_ctl,Update equip.ctl>>
sub-step in the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document,
you may have ended up with extra lines
at the end of _equip.ctl_ because in the
_beta1_ installation instruction, the FiLa10G input
select lines (including the comment line) were added
after the DBBC3 configuration lines (including the
comment line) and extra DBBC3 configuration lines were
added. Presumably you have already sorted this out
because the FS would probably not have run if the file
was changed as previously described. If you have not
sorted this out, the change that is needed is to move
the FiLa10G input select lines before the DBBC3
configuration lines and to delete any additional lines
after the DBBC3 configurations lines. In case it is
helpful, more detail is provided in the
<<beta2.adoc#_review_control_files,Review_control_files>>
sub-step of the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document.

. There were two changes to the _clpgm.ctl_ control file:

.. The flags for the _monX_ programs in _clpgm.ctl_ have
changed from `a` to `d`.
+
Please check the file to see if those lines are present. If so, and the second field is `a`, please change it to `d` for each occurrence.

.. The line for the _scnch_ window has been generalized to
cover Mark 5 recorders as well as Mark 6.
+

Please update your file accordingly after comparing to the
new default:

             cd /usr2/control
             diff clpgm.ctl /usr2/fs/st.default/control

. In the _stpgm.ctl_ control file, the line for
the _scnch_ window has been generalized to cover Mark 5
recorders as well as Mark 6.
+
Please update your file accordingly after comparing to the
new default:

             cd /usr2/control
             diff stpgm.ctl /usr2/fs/st.default/control

. If you use RDBEs in your back-end and want to use the
_rdbemsg_ utility to send operations messages, please
customize your _/usr2/control/rdbemsg.ctl_ control file.
In particular, you should add the _station_ line to the
file.  Full instructions are provided in the
<<beta2.adoc#\_update_rdbemsg_ctl,Update rdbemsg.ctl>>
sub-step of the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document.
which is a new sub-step since _beta1_.
+

NOTE: The instructions it <<beta2.adoc#\_update_rdbemsg_ctl,Update rdbemsg,ctl>>
sub-step also include setting
the `name` line in _rdbemsg.ctl_. That setting is not available as of
_beta2_; it is provided in a later update. However, setting it for
_beta2_ is benign and forward compatible.

=== Update .prc files from 10.0.0-beta1

If you initially upgraded from _9.13.2_, there is an optional
clean-up of your `calonnf`, `calonfp`, `caloffnf`, and
`calofffp` procedures, probably located in your _point_
procedure library in the
<<beta2.adoc#_remove_extra_if_commands,Remove extra if commands>>
sub-step of the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document.

=== Other updates

. Please review the
<<beta2.adoc#\_set_fs_display_server,Set FS_DISPLAY_SERVER>>
sub-step of the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document.
This sub-step did not exist for the
_beta1_ release.  It contains information about making use
of the display server the default, which is strongly
recommended.

. Please review the 
<<beta2.adoc#\_update_xresources,Update .Xresources>>
sub-step of the <<beta2.adoc#,beta2 update notes>> document.
This sub-step did not exist for the
_beta1_ release.  It contains information about updates
needed to the _~/.Xresources_ files for _oper_ and _prog_.
Please follow those directions.

. If you have installed the _beta1_ as part of installing
FSL10, you can optionally rearrange your _.bashrc_ and _.profile_
files to agree with the new default.
+
As _oper_, you can find the differences between your
_~/.bashrc_ and _~/.profile_ files and the new defaults using, e.g.,:
+

             cd
             diff .bashrc  /usr2/fs/st.default/oper
+
The main changes are:

.. Move certain commands within _~/.bashrc_ so they are only used by interactive shells.
.. Move `unset TMOUT` from _~/.profile_ to _~/.bashrc_.
.. Enable the display server in _~/.profile_, as also mentioned above.

+
Likewise you can do this similarly for _prog_ (and any AUID
accounts if you are using those).

. If you updated to a 64-bit platform and installed the _go_
language as part of that, according the
<<64-bit_conversion.adoc#\_option_b_installing_latest_go_language,Option B - Installing latest go language>>
sub-step of the <<64-bit_conversion.adoc#,Converting to a 64-bit system>> document,
then
you should register for _golang_ announcements as is now
described in that sub-step.

=== Review other changes

Please see the section <<Changes since 10.0.0-beta1>> below
for details of the changes in 10.0.0-beta2 compared to the
10.0.0-beta1 release.

== Changes since 10.0.0-beta1

There are separate sub-sections with summaries of changes in the FS
and _drudg_. Following those are sub-sections giving the details of the
changes.  [[details]] Each summary item has a clickable <<details,More details>>
link that leads to the detailed description of that item.

Clickable links such as
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/36[#36] connect to specific issues
reported at https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues.

A complete history of changes can be found using the `git log`
command.

The file _/usr2/fs/misc/changes.txt_ contains the old history of
changes in FS9. The file _/usr2/fs/misc/VENIX_changes.txt_ contains
the old history of changes in FS8. However these two files have been
merged into the history given by `git log`.

The history of _drudg_ is also described in more detail in
_/usr2/fs/drudg/change_log.txt_.

=== Details of FS changes

. [[fesh]] Improve _fesh_ (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/34[#34]).

.. A typo in the error message for when
the schedule is already downloaded was fixed (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/34[#34]). Thanks to
Morgan Goodrich (KPGO) for reporting this.

.. The internal version number was replaced with the FS version.

. [[equip.ctl]] Update example _equip.ctl_ (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/35[#35]).

.. The example DBBC3
firmware version is now more sensible (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/35[#35]). Thanks to Eskil Varenius (Onsala)
for reporting this.

.. The minimum DBBC3 firmware version required was added in a comment.

. [[fixmess]] Fix some error messages (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/43[#43] & https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/22[#22]).

.. Fixed errors in
_control/fserr.ctl_.  Errors in some double double-quotes (`""`)
lines and some incorrectly reused error codes were fixed (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/43[#43]).  Thanks to Alexander Neidhardt (Wettzell) for reporting
these.

.. The errors for a `tnx` command not being found when
attempting to manipulate its display setting were clarified
(closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/22[#22]).  Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for reporting this.

.. Error messages that should refer to the (not yet implemented)
`active_rdbes` and `active_mk6s` commands were corrected to no
longer incorrectly refer to the `rdbe_active` and `mk5_active`
commands, respectively.

.. Obsolete errors for the, no longer used, _sw.ctl_ control file
were removed.

. [[plog]] Improve _plog_.

.. Use of an environment variable `NETRC_DIR` was
added to support not having the _.netrc_ file in the user's home
directory was added. Please see `*plog -h*` for details on how to
use this.

.. The internal version number was replaced with the FS version.

. [[if]] Restore `if` command. It had accidentally been overlooked in
_beta1_. Thanks to Beppe Maccaferri (Medicina) for reporting
this.

. [[gpl]] Update GPL in files. The GPL header was added to the
_holog/MASK/*.m_ and _misc/mk6in*_ scripts and removed from
_fserver/tests/convey.*_.

. [[help]] Remove usage of `system()` call to find `help` files (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/40[#40] &
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/3[#3]). The `help` command no longer uses the `system()` to find the
correct `help` file to display.

. [[symlinks]] No longer set _/usr2/fs_ and _/usr2/st_ to be owned by _prog_. This
was an error in the _misc/fsinstall_ script.

. [[prc]] Add checking for a procedure or schedule file before attempting to
open it (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/45[#45]). This change is to avoid accidentally closing
an active procedure or schedule file if the new one specified in
the `proc=...` or `schedule=...` commands, respectively, does not
exist (or has incorrect permissions).  Previously, if the files
did not exist (or did not have the correct permission), the old
file would be closed. Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for pointing
out this inconsistency.
+
The old behavior was partly a consequence of how the original file
handling worked on HP-RTE systems, but is not sensible for how the
SNAP commands should work.  Note that this is a non-backward
compatible change in how the SNAP commands behave.
Previously supplying a non-existent procedure or schedule file
name would cause the closure of the corresponding file. Now to
close an open procedure or schedule without opening a new one, a
null parameter must be supplied, i.e., `proc=` or `schedule=`.  As
before, the latter will not close an open schedule procedure
library.

. [[header_lines]]  Add more log header lines. Log header lines were added for
`uname()` system information and the compile time value of the
`FC` environment variable.

. [[year]] Fix year wrap error message in procedure logging (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/23[#23]).
This fixed a benign and spurious error message if a log was kept
open past the end of the year and any procedures that had last
been logged in the previous year were executed again.  Thanks to
Eskil Varenius (Onsala) and Alexander Neidhardt (Wettzell) for
reporting this.

. [[prc2]] Fix remaining case of a closed procedure library causing a crash if
there was an attempt to execute a procedure from the library was
fixed. This case could happen if the schedule that was opened was
named _station_, which would lead to the closure of an already
open schedule procedure library (there cannot be _station_
schedule procedure library since _station_ can only be opened
once).

. [[helpsh]] Move X resources for _helpsh_ to _~/.Xresources_. This allows the
geometry and other parameter of the FS `help` display _xterm_ to be
controlled locally.

. [[tmout]] Move unsetting of `TMOUT` environment variable for _oper_ to
_~/.bashrc_ in the default files. This allows all interactive
shells to disable the time-out. Additionally, some settings were
rearranged in _~/.bashrc_ to make them only apply to interactive
shells (this was also done for _prog_ and AUID accounts). This
change is only relevant for stations using FSL10.

. [[dbbcn]] Improve error logging for _dbbcn_. The name of the program is now
correctly displayed.

. [[tpicd]] Improve `help` page for _tpicd_. Made it clearer that when in the
`no` mode, `data_valid=on` will only start logging of _tpicd_ data
when a schedule is running and not-blocked.  This behavior was
inherited from the VGOS branch where accidentally leaving _tpicd_
logging RDBE multi-cast data after closing a schedule or halting
it creates a lot of extra log entries. This is probable beneficial
for all back-ends.

. [[popen]] Add _popen_ time-out feature. There is a now a `-t ...` time-out
option. If the command being run has a time-out feature, it is
generally better to use the command's feature. See `help=sy` for
more details.

. [[server]] The FS display server is now recommended for
normal use. This was changed as of the _beta2_ release.

. [[clientn]] Make _fsclient_ honor the `-n` flag properly (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/48[#48]). This
eliminates opening "double" windows if _fsclient_ is run with `-n`
under an already running _fsclient_.

. [[clientnx]] Make _fsclient_ ignore prompt in no-X11 mode (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/49[#49]). If FS
client is in no-X11 mode, it created a _fs.prompt_ when instructed
by the server. This change removes that behaviour, though it may
cause an issue if no other clients exist to dismiss the prompt,
see issue https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/49[#49]. If this is a problem for anyone's use case we will
need a new feature here.

. [[fsserver]] Add _fsserver_ improvements and log support (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/29[#29] & https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/25[#25]).
These changes introduce new functionality to _fsserver_, as well as
simplifies some use cases.

.. The first major change is that the server now only needs to use
one socket when using _websockets_ -- address which start with
"ws://" (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/29[#29]). The new default base URL for all _fsserver_
streams and control channels is now:

    ws://127.0.0.1:7083
+
(70 83 are decimal ASCII encoding of `F` and `S`.)
+
This can be changed by editing `FS_SERVER_URL_BASE` in
_include/params.h_; however, we will likely introduce command-line
flag and/or environment variable to set this in the future.
+
This is should be safe to expose on the network (rather than just
the loop-back), but users may wish to use an HTTP(S) as a proxy to
provide some authentication/authorisation.
+
This was enabled by factoring out functionality _spub_ into a
reusable "buffered stream" library, which has been incorporated
into _fsserver_. All the behaviour of streams are now managed
within the _fsserver_ process rather than an external _spub_
instance.

.. The second major change of this patch is the addition of the FS
log to the streams available from the server (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/25[#25]).
(Previously only the "display" was available, which has a reduced
time-stamp format and filters some output.)
+
This is available at

    FS_SERVER_URL_BASE/log
+
that is, by default

    ws://127.0.0.1:7083/log

.. A third change is that the server now continues running after the
FS is terminated. This allows clients to detect the FS termination
and prevents a socket conflict if the FS is terminated and
restarted in quick succession. The only user visible impact will
be a slight delay if the FS is restarted quickly after termination
while the old session is finishing up. This also means, after an
FS upgrade, it's important to either shutdown the server
(`*fsserver stop*`) or restart the system.

.. Fourth, the server can now accept snap commands to be sent to FS,
e.g.:

   fsserver fs snap "terminate"
+
This allows clients to interact with the FS directly through
fsserver rather than needing access to _inject_snap_.
+
No filtering or authorisation is implemented on this command
channel, so it effectively allows complete command execution
privileges in the FS context to anyone with access to the socket.
Note this is also true for _inject_snap_ on a standard system. If
a station wishes to limit local access they can use
iptables/nftables, or use the server in UNIX socket mode and use
file system permissions. Stations that would like to enable remote
access should implement their own authentication/authorisation
that suits their needs, e.g. SSH port forwarding or HTTP proxying.

.. Finally, this patch also upgrades the included messaging library
_nng_ to version _1.3.0_, which brings with it some performance
improvements and bug fixes, the most obvious to FS users caused
some _ssub_ instances in "wait" mode to use a high amount of CPU
time.

. [[cls_chk]] Eliminate `cls_chk` error from `inject_snap -w ...` command when
an error occurs (partly closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/50[#50]). This was caused by
_inject_snap_ not implementing the new linkage that was added for
_fserr_. This is covered in issue https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/50[#50]. To correctly retrieve the
error message would have required making a new interface to
_fserr_ or subsuming it into library routine that both _ddout_
and _inject_snap_ could use. It was not possible to do either in the
available time. Instead _inject_snap_ was modified to output the error
without the message, but pointing out that the message can be
found in the log and display. Thanks to Dave Horsley (Hobart) for
reporting this.

. [[gnplt]] Fix labels in _gnplt_ windows that display the gain curve
coefficients (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/51[#51]). Previously the labels, when displayed
were in reverse order. In one window, there were no coefficient
labels at all. Thanks to Beppe Maccaferri (Medicina) for reporting
this and testing the solution.

. [[holog]] Improve _holog/MASK_. The elevation spacing was corrected for the
example in step (3), using _holog.m_. Axis titles were added to
_plot_mask.m_.

. [[onoff]] Fix _onoff_ for the DBBC3 rack (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/52[#52]). A code block from
_9.12.13_ in _onoff/get_samples.c_ had been omitted, preventing
sampling of the TPI values and causing _onoff_ to crash. Thanks to
Eskil Varenius (Onsala) for reporting that this caused a crash.

. [[cont_cal]] Add support for DBBC3 to `if=cont_cal,...` (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/54[#54]).  Thanks
to Eskil Varenius (Onsala) for reporting that this was missing.

. [[onoff_fivpt]] Update `help` pages for _onoff_ and _fivpt_. Added a section on
switching between continuous and non-continuous cal.  Removed
`if=cont_cal,,` in `calon`/`off`-`nf`/`fp` procedures.  Add
recovery method for misconfigured cal.

. [[day248]] Always check for day 248 problem in _setcl_ (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/56[#56]).
Previously _setcl_ only checked for the day 248 problem (due to
use of 32-bit arithmetic in the time handling code), if the time
model was _not_ `computer`. In principle, when the model is
`computer` there is no need to check for this issue.  However,
since the time is still managed with the same 32-bit arithmetic as
for the non-`computer` models, it is still necessary to check.
Not doing so was an oversight. The result was that there were no
warnings of an impending 248 day time problem if the model was
`computer`.  This is now fixed. Thanks to Richard Blaauw (WSRT),
and subsequently Jon Quick (HartRAO) for reporting this.

. [[monx]] Change the flags for the _monX_ programs in _clpgm.ctl_ from `a`
to `d`.  Since they do not depend on the FS, they can continue
running after the client is closed.

. [[scnch]] Generalize the _scnch_ window to cover Mark 5 recorders (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/61[#61]).  The _scnch_ window was initially developed for Mark 6
recorders. The form has now been generalized to cover Mark 5
recorders as wekk

. [[release_model]] Update _misc/release_model.txt_. The release steps were
clarified.

. [[notes]] Improve update notes.

.. The `-q` option was added to
the `pull` to suppress the detached HEAD warning.

.. A sentence was added to the description of the change to using
_git_ that it now even more important to not change the contents
of the _/usr2/fs_ source tree.  Changing the source tree will make
it harder to install bug fixes and updates.

.. The paths to the example control files now include the needed
intermediate directory _fs/_.

.. The sub-steps for updating the control files were corrected
to properly
depend or not depend on the old version being _9.12.12_.

.. A sub-step was added to make using the FS display server the default.

.. A sub-step was added for updating the _~/.Xresources_ file for _oper_
and _prog_.

.. A sub-step to update where the `TMOUT` environment variable is unset
for stations using FSL10 was added.

.. A recommendation was added to sign-up for the _go_ language
announcements to be informed of security updates if you are
installing the latest version of _go_ language.

=== Details of drudg changes

. [[uninit]] Fix uninitialized variables. Several previously uninitialized variables are
    now initialized. As part of this `implicit none` was added to all FORTRAN
    routines that did not have it before, except for _xat.f_.

. [[preob]] Fix missing `preob` when `EARLY` start non-zero. This was broken
    in the implementation of staggered start for FS _9.13.0_ and has been
    restored.

. [[wait]] Add support for additional wait at the end of recording for
    broadband. This allows schedules to include a fixed amount of
    additional wait for buffering per station. This seems to be needed
    for Mark 6 recorders in configurations that otherwise would
    require no buffer time for disks that are slower than nominal.

. [[comment]] Update comment on line three of _.snp_ files. Previously at the
    end of line, the number of passes and the tape length were
    listed. Since there is no tape support, these fields were replaced
    with the recorder type.
