== Introduction

This update is intended as a test version for all stations using the
FS. This includes both stations using the main (non-VGOS) branch
(latest version _9.13.2_) and the VGOS branch (latest versions
_9.12.10_-_9.12.13_). Installing the new version as update for these
cases is fairly simple but has several steps, see the
<<Upgrading from an FS9 version>>
section below.

The most significant changes in _10.0.0_ are:

. One unified version for all FS users.

+

Both non-VGOS and VGOS operations are supported by the new version.
Previous installations of the main (non-VGOS) branch will need to have
some new local control files added.

+

The most significant change for users is that previous main branch users will
find that in the new FS input is case sensitive, as it was already
in the VGOS branch.

. Support for use on both 32- and 64-bit systems.

+

The new version should run on 32-bit systems that currently support
the FS (we expect to support as far back as FSL8, but currently FSL9
is the limit), as well as on 64-bit systems. The update notice
includes instructions for transitioning to a 64-bit system, which may
require some relatively simple changes to station software. See the
<<64-bit_conversion.adoc#,64-bit conversion>> document for more details.

+

A new FS Linux distribution, FSL10 (based on Debian _Stretch_), is now
available for 64-bit (and 32-bit) use. We recommend using this
distribution if you would like to move to using a 64-bit OS or need a
32-bit OS that is still under support (the base Debian distribution,
_Wheezy_, used for FSL9, and those for older FSLx versions, is no longer under
support). This also may be an alternative for users with distributions
(such as FSL7) that are too old to support the current FS.  Installation
instructions for FSL10 can be found at
<https://nvi-inc.github.io/fsl10>.

+

. Version control with _git_.

+

The FS source is now managed using _git_ and _github_ is used for
distribution. The source code is now under the GPL3 license.

+

The details of the model used for FS releases under _git_ are
described in the <<../misc/release_model.adoc#,Release Model>> document.

+

This change increases the importance of not modifying the
_/usr2/fs_ directory tree since such changes will make it more
difficult to simply `pull` updates to install bug fixes and new
features.

. The FS display server is now recommended for normal use.

+

This change is new as of the _beta2_ release.

Please also see the section <<Changes from FS9>> below for details of
the changes compared to the latest FS9 versions.

Essential contributions were made by Dave Horsley (UTAS, Australia and
NVI/GSFC) and Tetsuro Kondo (NICT, Japan and SHAO, China). Kondo-san
pioneered 64-bit support in the FS with his 64-bit implementations for
the Sejong and Ishioka stations. Dave built on his work in developing
a version that would support 32- and 64-bit systems.

Dave also single-handedly imported the entire existent history of FS
source code into _git_. This includes over 130 FS9 versions (under
Linux), 17 FS8 versions (under VENIX), and two older versions (under HP
RTE-1000/A) going back to version 5.5 in 1988.  Having the source code
in _git_ greatly simplified the task of merging the main and VGOS
branches. Dave also did the most critical work on that and provided
excellent guidance on using _git_. Having the historical code in _git_
is a great resource for understanding the evolution of the code.

As always, we are deeply indebted to Jonathan Quick (HartRAO, South
Africa) for his many significant contributions that go far beyond what
is explicitly mentioned below. In this particular case, his
contributions include testing and insights for adapting the code for
64-bit use, patiently solving various problems, developing FSL10,
making many helpful suggestions for changes, testing, and providing feedback.

We also think Beppe Maccaferri (Medicina) for being a diligent beta
tester, reporting bugs, helping test several fixes, and making helpful
suggestions for changes.

We would also like thank Eskil Varenius (Onsala) bug reports and
feedback, particularly on DBBC3 related issues.

=== Miscellaneous

<<../misc/known_bugs.adoc#,Known bugs>> document with the known bugs list from FS9.

<<../misc/install_reference.adoc#,Installation reference>> document with other useful install
information is available.  It includes seven sub-sections:


. <<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_upgrading_from_fs_versions_before_the_previous_stable,Upgrading from FS versions before the previous stable>>
. <<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_example_standard_procedure_libraries,Example standard procedure libraries>>
. <<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_cut_and_paste_installation_tips,Cut-and-paste installation tips>>
. <<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_making_a_back_up_before_installing,Making a back-up before installing>>

. <<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_set_operations_file_permissions,Set operations file permissions>>
. <<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_fix_prc_file_define_lines,Fix .prc file define lines>>

If you haven't upgraded or installed the FS before, you may want to
review the appendix.  It is _strongly_ recommended that you back-up your
operational system before upgrading.

== Upgrading from an FS9 version

This section covers upgrading from FS9, which was always 32-bit
only, to _10.0.0-beta2_.  Certain steps are also utilized for
converting to a 64-bit system, as described in the
<<64-bit_conversion.adoc#,Converting to a 64-bit system>> document.
To accommodate that, there are a few embedded
comments for handling 64-bit systems.

There are two possible paths for upgrading:

. Upgrading from a main branch version. The main branch versions
are numbered _9.13.x_ and _9.11.x_ or older.  Specifically, versions
_9.12.x_ are not part of the main branch.  If you are upgrading
from a main branch version, it is assumed that upgrade is from
_9.13.2_, the previous stable release.  If you have a main branch
version older than version _9.13.2_ you should upgrade to _9.13.2_
first, please refer to the
<<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_upgrading_from_fs_versions_before_the_previous_stable,Upgrading from FS versions before the previous stable>>
section in the
<<../misc/install_reference.adoc#,Installation reference>> document
for more information.

. Upgrading from a VGOS branch version.  The VGOS branch versions
are numbered _9.12.x_.  The instructions provided in this section
are for installing as an upgrade to versions
_9.12.10_-_9.12.13_, the latest VGOS branch releases. As far as we
know, no other VGOS versions are in use.  If you have a different
version, please email Ed for more information.

The upgrade instructions for the update from the old main branch and
the old VGOS branch differ only in the step
<<Update control files>>. The
installation steps for upgrading are:

=== Back-up your operational system

Having a back-up to return to
will allow you to continue operations in case something goes
wrong with the installation.  For more details, please see the
<<../misc/install_reference.adoc#_making_a_back_up_before_installing,Making a back-up before installing>>
section in the
<<../misc/install_reference.adoc#,Installation reference>> document.

NOTE: If you are using FSL10 with a RAID, that sub-section points you to the
improved backup and test procedure that is available with
that distribution.

NOTE: That section also includes a description of how to
preserve your operational files and switch back and forth
between an operational and a test set-up by changing
symbolic links.

=== Login as root

Login as _root_.

=== Download the FS

Place a copy of the FS _git_ repository in the _/usr2_ directory on
your computer. For example, you might do the following:

       cd /usr2
       git clone https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs.git fs-git

or alternatively, if you are using FSL8 or other old Linux
distribution, or otherwise need to use _ssh_ instead:

       cd /usr2
       git clone git@github.com:nvi-inc/fs fs-git

NOTE: Using _ssh_ requires you to have a _gitub_ account and for you
to add an _ssh_ public key from your machine's _root_ account to your _github_ account. For more information, go to
https://github.com/join and
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account.

=== Checkout the release

Checkout the _beta2_ release from the local repository:

       cd fs-git
       git checkout -q 10.0.0-beta2

=== Set the /usr2/fs link

Set the link for the new FS version:

       cd /usr2/fs-git
       make install

Answer `*y*` to confirm installation.

NOTE: This step will change your _/usr2/fs_ symbolic link to point to
           _/usr2/fs-git_. To switch back to your old version, you
           will need to change the link manually.

The `make install` command may create and possibly rename some
existing directories if the FS was never installed on this system
before.  However, if you are using this step as part of upgrading
on your 32-bit system (this step is not used on a 64-bit system
you may be converting to), this should not be an issue.

=== Fix file permissions

Having the wrong ownership and/or permissions on the operational
files (procedure libraries, control files, schedules, and logs)
can cause errors during FS operations.  For a full discussion,
please refer to the
<<../misc/install_reference.adoc#\_set_operations_file_permissions,Set operations file permissions>>
section of the
<<../misc/install_reference.adoc#,Installation reference>> document.
For stations where all the operational files are
expected to owned by user _oper_ in group _rtx_, with permissions
`ug+rw,o+r,o-w`, the following command will enforce this (note
that the _execute_/_search_ bits are not changed):

       /usr2/fs/misc/fix_perm

Answer `*y*` to the prompt if you wish to proceed. It is recommended for most stations.

=== Login as prog

IMPORTANT: Logout as _root_, and login as _prog_.

=== Set FORTRAN compiler

Starting with version _10.0.0_, the standard
FORTRAN compiler for use with the FS is _f95_ (_gfortran_).
We recommend that you use it. On the 32-bit systems you can
still use _fort77_, but you should only use it if you either
don't have _f95_ or if you have FORTRAN station code that
is too difficult to convert to _f95_, see sub-step <<Conversion of FORTRAN code>> for more
details.

To select _f95_ as your compiler, you will need to set the
`FC` variable to this value. If your shell is _tcsh_ you can
use:

          setenv FC f95

If your shell is _bash_, you can use:

          export FC=f95

NOTE: For beta testing on a 32-bit system, you may not want to
make this change permanent since it is incompatible with
pre-_10.0.0_ versions.

To make this change permanent, you should add the appropriate
command to the appropriate _rc_ file depending on your login
shell: _~prog/.login_ for _tcsh_ or probably _~prog/.profile_
for _bash_.

=== Make the FS

          cd /usr2/fs
          make >& /dev/null

and then

          make -s

to confirm that everything compiled correctly (no news is good
news).

=== Update station programs

This step is for modifying your station programs in _/usr2/st_.  There
are two possible issues:

==== Case sensitive strings in antenna= commands

In FS9 versions, the strings used in `antenna=...` commands were always
converted to uppercase before being sent to _antcn_.  An part of the FS
input being case sensitive that no longer happens.  If your
antenna, or your side of the antenna interface, requires that the
strings passed by the `antenna=...` command are uppercase, you have
two options:

. Convert your code. For simple backward compatibility,
change you _antcn_ program to always convert the
`antenna=...` strings to upper case. Alternatively, make
your code case insensitive.

. Convert the strings in your `antenna=...` commands
wherever they occur: SNAP procedures, SNAP schedules,
external programs, or scripts, to upper case. Field system
input is now case sensitive.

The former choice is probably the easier, but in some
cases the second  may be better. If you have questions about which to
use and how to do it, please email Ed.

==== Conversion of FORTRAN code

If you have station programs in
FORTRAN, please email Ed so he is
aware, but basically you have two options (also see step <<Set FORTRAN compiler>>):

. Change to using _f95_ for both the FS and your station
FORTRAN programs.   It is recommended that
you follow this approach for 32-bit systems and it is
necessary when moving to a 64-bit system.
+

You will need to adapt your __Makefile__s
to use the same compiler options as the FS, which can be
found in _/usr2/fs/include.mk_.
As a first cut, it may work to add the following two lines
to your __Makefile__s for FORTRAN programs:

    FFLAGS  += -ff2c -I../../fs/include -fno-range-check -finit-local-zero -fno-automatic -fbackslash
    FLIBS   += -lgfortran -lm

. Continue to use _fort77_ for both the
FS and your station programs. You should follow this approach _only_ if
you are on a 32-bit system and it is too difficult to convert to
_f95_.

=== Make local software

If _/usr2/st/Makefile_ is set-up in the standard way, you can do this with:

       cd /usr2/st
       make rmdoto rmexe all

NOTE: At this point, you are only trying to verify the code will _make_
successfully.  You may still need to debug it in the step <<Test the FS>>
below.

=== Reboot

IMPORTANT: Reboot the computer.  This is necessary to allocate FS, and possibly station, shared
memory for the new version.

=== Login as oper

The remaining steps assume you are logged in as _oper_.

=== Update control files

This step is for updates to the local control files. There are five
sub-steps:

. <<Update stcmd.ctl>>
. <<Copy control files>>
. <<Update equip.ctl>>
. <<Review control files>>
. <<Update rdbemsg.ctl>>

Differences for updating from different previous versions are
noted.  Please read all cases in each sub-step carefully to make
sure you find all the cases for your old version; sometimes an old
version is included in more than one case in a sub-step.

==== Update stcmd.ctl

The non-comments lines need another digit added to the
subroutine number. This sub-step is only need for updates from
_9.13.2_. You can fix your file with the commands:

  cd /usr2/control
  /usr2/fs/misc/cmdctlfix6 stcmd.ctl

You may also want to expand the (typically) second comment
line to correspond to the new format by adding a `U` after
character 18 to read as:

    *COMMAND     SEG SUBPA BO

==== Copy control files

You will need to execute the following commands to copy new
files that are needed (cut-and-paste is your friend). There
are three cases depending on what your old version was:

. Old versions _9.12.10_ and _9.12.11_:

               cd /usr2/control
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/clpgm.ctl .
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/rdbemsg.ctl .

. Old versions _9.12.12_ and _9.12.13_:

               cd /usr2/control
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/rdbemsg.ctl .

. Old version _9.13.2_:

               cd /usr2/control
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/dbba2.ctl .
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/mk6c?.ctl .
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/monit6.ctl .
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/rdbc?.ctl .
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/rdbe.ctl .
               cp /usr2/fs/st.default/control/rdbemsg.ctl .

==== Update equip.ctl

It is necessary to add lines for the
FiLa10G input select and the DBBC3 configuration.  There
are three cases, please check which applies for you.  In any
event, you should compare your _equip.ctl_ to the example as
described when you get to sub-step <<Review control files>> below, to make sure there are
no duplicated lines or other problems caused by the commands
in this current sub-step, i.e., <<Update equip.ctl>>.

. If your old version was _9.12.10_ or _9.12.11_, you will need
to add the final four lines of the example _equip.ctl_
file to yours:

  cd /usr2/control
  tail -n 4 /usr2/fs/st.default/control/equip.ctl >>equip.ctl

. If your old version was _9.12.12_ or _9.12.13_, you will need
to insert two lines before the final two lines.  This is
covered in sub-step <<Review control files>> below.

. If your old version was _9.13.2_, you will need to add the
final two lines of the example _equip.ctl_ file to yours:

  cd /usr2/control
  tail -n 2 /usr2/fs/st.default/control/equip.ctl >>equip.ctl

==== Review control files

You should compare your versions of the following files:

. _clpgm.ctl_
. _equip.ctl_
. _stpgm.ctl_

to the examples, e.g., using:

          cd /usr2/control
          diff clpgm.ctl /usr2/fs/st.default/control/ | less

and consider whether and what changes you should make to your
copies.

The following sub-sections give the details of the changes in these files. You will
need to make the corresponding changes to your copies of the
files.

===== Review clpgm.ctl

You may be able to just replace your copy with the new one.

. Old versions _9.12.10_ and _9.12.11_:
+
This file was not present so the new default version (copied by
commands in sub-step <<Copy control files>> above) should not
require modification.

. Old versions _9.12.12_, _9.12.13_, and _9.13.2_:

.. The `-title ...`  parameter for each
window was removed so that it is uniquely
supplied by the _.Xresources_ file.

.. The value of the `-name`
parameter for _erchk_ was changed from `ERRORS`
to `erchk`.

.. The useful display window _scnch_ was added.

.. The _xterm_
program was added.

.. For RDBE systems, the useful RDBE display windows: _monit6_,
and _monX_ (_X_=[_a_-_d_]) were added. The _monan_ program was added
to the default since it is used at several sites. If these are not
relevant for your site, you may prefer to not add them.

===== Review equip.ctl

This file has the most complicated changes.
Please read all clauses to make sure you see
all that apply to your old version.

There are two sub-sections. The first
sub-section covers changes to non-comment lines; the
second, comments. The former are required. The
later are in some sense optional, especially
when they refer to equipment you don't (or
never will) have. However, changing them now
may help avoid confusion at a later date.

======  Non-comment lines

.  Old versions _9.12.10_-_9.12.13_:

.. The line for DBBC PFB version was changed to have a
minimum version number of `v15_1`. The line is
shown here with the typical preceding comment:

    *DBBC PFB version
    v15_1    v15_1 or later

.. The line that defines the DBBC2 CoMo configuration was changed. Please
see item (12) in the installation instructions in _/usr2/fs/misc/fs91119up.txt_ for
full details on handling this. However, the following commands will
probably make the needed change if you don't have a DBBC2 or if your
DBBC2 configuration is four CoMos with one Core per CoMo:

  cd /usr2/control
  /usr2/fs/misc/dbbc_equip '1 1 1 1' equip.ctl
+
If the script prints a warning about the number
of IF power conversions being incorrect, the
issue must be resolved before continuing,
either by adjusting the number of power
conversions, adjusting the CoMo configuration,
or both.

. Old versions _9.12.10_ and _9.12.11_:
+
A FiLa10G input select line was added, but
sub-step <<Update equip.ctl>> above should have handled that.

. Old versions _9.12.12_ and _9.12.13_:
+
A "stanza" (actually one comment and one FiLa10G
input select line) was inserted before the
final "stanza" (typically one comment and one
DBBC3 configuration line). An example of the
lines inserted can be found near the end of the
default example _/usr2/fs/st.default/control/equip.ctl_ file. They are
listed here as well (one comment and one
FiLa10G input select line):

    *FiLa10G input select, one of: vsi1, vsi2, vsi1-2, vsi1-2-3-4, gps, tvg
    vsi1-2

. Old versions _9.12.10_, _9.12.11_, and _9.13.2_:
+
A new line for the DBBC3 configuration was added at the end, but sub-step
<<Update equip.ctl>>  above should have handled that.

====== Comment lines

. All old versions:
+
Compared to all old versions, comment lines
were added or modified for new equipment type
options.
+
. Old versions _9.12.10_-_9.12.13_:
+
The trailing comment on the line for the met. device was
reworded.

. Old versions _9.12.10_-_9.12.13_:
+
The comment lines describing the available clock
rates was completely rewritten and greatly
expanded, and an additional clock rate (`128`)
was appended to the end of the comment on
the clock rate line itself.

===== Review stpgm.ctl

. All old versions

IMPORTANT: If you are _not_ planning to use the FS display
server, we recommend you comment out the lines
for _erchk_, _monit2_, and _scnch_ and not add any other _monitX_ programs. If they are
used in _stpgm.ctl_ without the display server and they are
accidentally closed, the FS will be killed.

.. The line for _erchk_ is now uncommented and differs from the
previous commented version with the addition of the `-name erchk`
parameter and the removal of the `-title ...` and `-geom ...` parameters,
so that the latter two are uniquely supplied by the _.Xresources_
file.

.. New lines were
added for _monit2_, and _scnch_ for when the
display server is in use.
+
If you are using the display server you may
want to add other _monitX_ programs. If so, you
may also want to add resources for them (if
 they aren't already there) in the
_~/.Xresources_ files for _oper_ and _prog_.

==== Update rdbemsg.ctl

If you have RDBEs for your back-end and will use the _rdbemsg_
utility to send operations messages, you will need to
customize your _/usr2/control/rdbemsg.ctl_ file.

. You will need to update the `station` two letter code (lower
case) and the `name` station name to your station's values. The
station name is usually defined in the
_/usr2/control/location.ctl_ file.

. If you don't have a _HubPC_ (_mci_) node for front end monitor
and control, you should comment out that line.

. You should set the addresses for the RBDE-A (`R-A`) through RDBE-D
(`R-D`). The example file uses aliases, _rdbea_ through _rdbed_, that
you can define in _/etc/hosts_.  Likewise, if you have an _mci_ node,
you should set its alias, _hubpc_, in _/etc/hosts_. (It is usually
necessary to have _root_ access to modify _/etc/hosts_.)  Alternatively
of course, you can use any scheme you prefer for defining these
addresses in _rdbemsg.ctl_.

. The default email address `to` is for the `ivs-vgos-ops` mail
list. You can of course change that to whatever you like. You
can also temporarily override the address in the _rdbemsg_
utility itself.

=== Update .prc files

This step is for updates to your SNAP _.prc_ procedure libraries.
The are two sub-steps. 
Only the  change in the first is required: converting from using the
old FS _go_
program to _rte_go_. The change in the second is
optional and only relevant if upgrading from _9.13.2_: removing
`if=cont_cal,,` from the `fivpt` and `onoff` procedures for
`calon` and `caloff` procedures.

==== Convert from go to rte_go

Convert use of the old FS _go_ program to use _rte_go_. This
is required because the compiler for the _go_ language
conflicts with the old program name _go_. This change is necessary even if
you do not have the _go_ language compiler installed.

To make this change for all your _.prc_ procedure libraries,
execute:

           cd /usr2/proc
           /usr2/fs/misc/go_fix *.prc

Files that are changed will have a pre-change back-up copy
with the extension _.bak_. You can use the _.bak_ file to
recover in case of a problem.

==== Remove extra if commands

This sub-step is optional and only relevant if you are upgrading
from _9.13.2_. You can remove the `if=cont_cal,,` as a prefix from before the
`calon` and `caloff` commands in you `calonnf`, `calonfp`,
`caloffnf`, and `calofffp` procedures, probably located in your
_point_ procedure library. This is just a clean-up and not
making this change will have no impact.

=== Miscellaneous FS related changes

There are two changes: set the `FS_DISPLAY_SERVER` environment variable
for _oper_ and _prog_ (this is only needed if you were not running the
FS display server before) and update the _~/.Xresources_ file for the
_oper_ and _prog_ accounts.

==== Set FS_DISPLAY_SERVER

Set the `FS_DISPLAY_SERVER` environment variable for _oper_ and
_prog_.  This will make using the display server the default for
your system.  We strongly recommend this, but if it is not suitable
for you for some reason you can skip this.  If you are
already using the display server, you can also skip this sub-step.

IMPORTANT: If you don't use the
display server, you will probably need to update the _stpgm.ctl_ file for that
case as described in sub-step <<Review stpgm.ctl>> above.

If _oper_ uses the _bash_ shell then in the _~oper/.profile_
file, you can uncomment or insert

          export FS_DISPLAY_SERVER=on

If _oper_ uses the _tcsh_ shell then in the _~oper/.login_
file, you can uncomment or insert

          setenv  FS_DISPLAY_SERVER on

You should logout and login again after making this change.

You should  make the corresponding change for _prog_ while logged
in as _prog_.

==== Update .Xresources

The main change was to add values for the _erchk_,
_scnch_, and _helpsh_  windows.  There were some minor changes
for other windows, but what to use for the changed values may
depend on the resolution of your display.  The example values
worked well for an FSL10 installation on a system with a
non-GPU CPU.

[TIP]
====

A strategy for setting the `geometry` resource for a window is:

. Manually adjust the position of the window with the mouse to where you want it to be.

. Run the _xwininfo_ program

. Position the cursor on the window and click.

. Copy the string output for the `-geometry` parameter, e.g, `80x24+0+0`.

. Paste the string as the value for `geometry` resource for that window in the _~/.Xresources_ file.

You will need to logout and login again (or reload
the X-resources a different way) for the change to become
effective.
====


As _oper_, you can find the differences between your file and
the example file with:

  cd
  diff .Xresources /usr2/fs/st.default/oper

Please make any changes to your file that you find
appropriate, but at a minimum you should probably add the
lines for _monit6_, _erchk_, _scnch_, and _helpsh_ if not already
present. You will need to logout and login again (or reload
the X-resources a different way) for the changes to become
effective.

All the new lines are at the end of the file, if need to add
lines for _monit6_, _erchk_, _scnch_, and _helpsh_, you can
use:

  cd
  tail -n 24 /usr2/fs/st.default/st.default/oper/.Xresources >>.Xresources

To add lines for just _erchk_, _scnch_, and _helpsh_, you can
use:

  cd
  tail -n 20 /usr2/fs/st.default/st.default/oper/.Xresources >>.Xresources

To add lines for just _helpsh_, you can
use:

  cd
  tail -n 6 /usr2/fs/st.default/st.default/oper/.Xresources >>.Xresources

You can update _prog_'s _.Xresources_ file similarly, but you
will need to be logged in as _prog_.

=== Miscellaneous FSLx changes

None are required for this update.

===  Test the FS

NOTE: If you are following this step on your
32-bit system as part of the process in the 
<<64-bit_conversion.adoc#,Converting to a 64-bit system>>
docment, you may prefer to only do a quick check now and
save extensive testing until you are verifying the 64-bit
installation. You could always go back and do more testing
on the 32-bit system to help resolve the origin of problems
that are noticed on the 64-bit system.

Generally speaking, a fairly thorough test is to run a test
experiment.  Start with using _drudg_ to rotate a schedule,
__drudg__ing it to make _.snp_ and _.prc_ files, making listings,
and any other pre-experiment preparation and tests you normally
do, then execute part of schedule, and perform any normal
post-experiment plotting and clean-up that you do.  The idea here
is to verify that everything works as you expect for normal
operations.

=== Consider when to update your back-ups

NOTE: This step may not be appropriate if you are beta testing
since the beta test versions are not intended for
operations.

It would be prudent to wait until you have successfully run an
experiment or two and preferably received word that the
experiment(s) produced good data.  The chances of needing to use
your back-up should be small.  If something does happen, you can
copy the back-up to the (now assumed bad) updated disk.  You can
then either use the restored disk or apply the FS update again.
The FSL10 test procedure has more options for recovery.  Managing
this is a lot easier and safer if you have a third disk.

== Changes from FS9

[[details]] There are separate sub-sections with summaries of changes
in the FS and _drudg_. Following those are sub-sections giving the
details of the changes.  Each summary item has a clickable
<<details,More details>> link that leads to the detailed description
of that item.

Each sub-section is divided into three parts:

. Changes that are in common since FS9
+
These parts cover changes compared
to both FS9 branches. These are changes that have been introduced in version _10.0.0_.

. Changes relative to the main branch
+
These parts cover changes that are only relative to the main
branch, specifically version _9.13.2_. These are primarily features that were in the VGOS branch but
not in the main branch.

. Changes relative to the VGOS branch
+
These sparts cover changes that are only relative to the VGOS
branch, specifically version _9.12.13_.  These are primarily features that were in the main branch but
not in the VGOS branch.


Clickable links such as
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/36[#36] connect to specific issues
reported at https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues.

A complete history of changes can be found using the `git log`
command.

The file _/usr2/fs/misc/changes.txt_ contains the old history of
changes in FS9. The file _/usr2/fs/misc/VENIX_changes.txt_ contains
the old history of changes in FS8. However these two files have been
merged into the history given by `git log`.

The history of _drudg_ is also described in more detail in
_/usr2/fs/drudg/change_log.txt_.

#TODO: Complete this sub-section.#

=== Details of FS changes

This sub-section is divided into three parts. Please see
<<Changes from FS9>> above for an explanation of the parts.

==== Changes that are in common since FS9

. [[unified]] One unified version for all FS users.

+

Both non-VGOS and VGOS operations are supported by the new version.
Previous installations of the main (non-VGOS) branch will need to have
some new local control files added.

+

The most significant change for users is that previous main branch users will
find that in the new FS input is case sensitive, as it was already
in the VGOS branch.


. [[bit3264]] Support for use on both 32- and 64-bit systems.

+

The new version should run on 32-bit systems that currently support
the FS (we expect to support as far back as FSL8, but currently FSL9
is the limit), as well as on 64-bit systems. The
<<64-bit_conversion.adoc#,Converting to a 64-bit system>> document
contains instructions for transitioning to a 64-bit system.

+

The key change to the source code to make this compatibility possible
is avoiding use of ``long int``s, except where they are required for
system calls, particularly in fixed length data structures. A tool,
_unlongify_ was developed by Dave Horsley to help convert the FS code.
It is available to help convert station code. It use is described in 
<<64-bit_conversion.adoc#_handling_c_station_code,Handling C station code>>
section of the
<<64-bit_conversion.adoc#,Converting to a 64-bit system>> document.

+

. [[usegit]] Version control with _git_.

+

The FS source is now managed using _git_ and _github_ is used for
distribution. The source code is now under the GPL3 license.

+

The details of the model used for FS releases under _git_ are
described in the <<../misc/release_model.adoc#,Release Model>> document.

+

This change increases the importance of not modifying the
_/usr2/fs_ directory tree since such changes will make it more
difficult to simply `pull` updates to install bug fixes and new
features.

. [[makefile]] The FS uses a new _Makefile_ scheme. This is
accomplished by including the _/usr2/fs/include.mk_ file in every
Makefile except for _drudg_ and its libraries. The scheme is "opt-in"
so it is not necessary for every program or station programs to
participate. Within the FS source tree, only _drudg_ and its libraries
don't use it.  An explanation of the new scheme is provided in
_/usr2/fs/misc/fs10_makefile.md_.

. [[fesh]] Improve _fesh_ (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/34[#34]).

.. A typo in the error message for when
the schedule is already downloaded was fixed (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/34[#34]). Thanks to
Morgan Goodrich (KPGO) for reporting this.

.. The internal version number was replaced with the FS version.

. [[equip.ctl]] Update example _equip.ctl_ (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/35[#35]).

.. The example DBBC3
firmware version is now more sensible (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/35[#35]). Thanks to Eskil Varenius (Onsala)
for reporting this.

.. The minimum DBBC3 firmware version required was added in a comment.

. [[fixmess]] Fix some error messages (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/43[#43] & https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/22[#22]).

.. Fixed errors in
_control/fserr.ctl_.  Errors in some double double-quotes (`""`)
lines and some incorrectly reused error codes were fixed (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/43[#43]).  Thanks to Alexander Neidhardt (Wettzell) for reporting
these.

.. The errors for a `tnx` command not being found when
attempting to manipulate its display setting were clarified
(closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/22[#22]).  Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for reporting this.

.. Error messages that should refer to the (not yet implemented)
`active_rdbes` and `active_mk6s` commands were corrected to no
longer incorrectly refer to the `rdbe_active` and `mk5_active`
commands, respectively.

.. Obsolete errors for the, no longer used, _sw.ctl_ control file
were removed.

. [[plog]] Improve _plog_.

.. Use of an environment variable `NETRC_DIR` was
added to support not having the _.netrc_ file in the user's home
directory was added. Please see `*plog -h*` for details on how to
use this.

.. The internal version number was replaced with the FS version.

. [[if]] Restore `if` command. It had accidentally been overlooked in
_beta1_. Thanks to Beppe Maccaferri (Medicina) for reporting
this.

. [[gpl]] Update GPL in files. The GPL header was added to the
_holog/MASK/*.m_ and _misc/mk6in*_ scripts and removed from
_fserver/tests/convey.*_.

. [[help]] Remove usage of `system()` call to find `help` files (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/40[#40] &
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/3[#3]). The `help` command no longer uses the `system()` to find the
correct `help` file to display.

. [[symlinks]] No longer set _/usr2/fs_ and _/usr2/st_ to be owned by _prog_. This
was an error in the _misc/fsinstall_ script.

. [[prc]] Add checking for a procedure or schedule file before attempting to
open it (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/45[#45]). This change is to avoid accidentally closing
an active procedure or schedule file if the new one specified in
the `proc=...` or `schedule=...` commands, respectively, does not
exist (or has incorrect permissions).  Previously, if the files
did not exist (or did not have the correct permission), the old
file would be closed. Thanks to Jon Quick (HartRAO) for pointing
out this inconsistency.
+
The old behavior was partly a consequence of how the original file
handling worked on HP-RTE systems, but is not sensible for how the
SNAP commands should work.  Note that this is a non-backward
compatible change in how the SNAP commands behave.
Previously supplying a non-existent procedure or schedule file
name would cause the closure of the corresponding file. Now to
close an open procedure or schedule without opening a new one, a
null parameter must be supplied, i.e., `proc=` or `schedule=`.  As
before, the latter will not close an open schedule procedure
library.

. [[header_lines]]  Add more log header lines. Log header lines were added for
`uname()` system information and the compile time value of the
`FC` environment variable.

. [[year]] Fix year wrap error message in procedure logging (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/23[#23]).
This fixed a benign and spurious error message if a log was kept
open past the end of the year and any procedures that had last
been logged in the previous year were executed again.  Thanks to
Eskil Varenius (Onsala) and Alexander Neidhardt (Wettzell) for
reporting this.

. [[prc2]] Fix remaining case of a closed procedure library causing a crash if
there was an attempt to execute a procedure from the library was
fixed. This case could happen if the schedule that was opened was
named _station_, which would lead to the closure of an already
open schedule procedure library (there cannot be _station_
schedule procedure library since _station_ can only be opened
once).

. [[helpsh]] Move X resources for _helpsh_ to _~/.Xresources_. This allows the
geometry and other parameter of the FS `help` display _xterm_ to be
controlled locally.

. [[tmout]] Move unsetting of `TMOUT` environment variable for _oper_ to
_~/.bashrc_ in the default files. This allows all interactive
shells to disable the time-out. Additionally, some settings were
rearranged in _~/.bashrc_ to make them only apply to interactive
shells (this was also done for _prog_ and AUID accounts). This
change is only relevant for stations using FSL10.

. [[dbbcn]] Improve error logging for _dbbcn_. The name of the program is now
correctly displayed.

. [[tpicd]] Improve `help` page for _tpicd_. Made it clearer that when in the
`no` mode, `data_valid=on` will only start logging of _tpicd_ data
when a schedule is running and not-blocked.  This behavior was
inherited from the VGOS branch where accidentally leaving _tpicd_
logging RDBE multi-cast data after closing a schedule or halting
it creates a lot of extra log entries. This is probable beneficial
for all back-ends.

. [[popen]] Add _popen_ time-out feature. There is a now a `-t ...` time-out
option. If the command being run has a time-out feature, it is
generally better to use the command's feature. See `help=sy` for
more details.

. [[server]] The FS display server is now recommended for
normal use. This was changed as of the _beta2_ release.

. [[clientn]] Make _fsclient_ honor the `-n` flag properly (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/48[#48]). This
eliminates opening "double" windows if _fsclient_ is run with `-n`
under an already running _fsclient_.

. [[clientnx]] Make _fsclient_ ignore prompt in no-X11 mode (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/49[#49]). If FS
client is in no-X11 mode, it created a _fs.prompt_ when instructed
by the server. This change removes that behaviour, though it may
cause an issue if no other clients exist to dismiss the prompt,
see issue https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/49[#49]. If this is a problem for anyone's use case we will
need a new feature here.

. [[fsserver]] Add _fsserver_ improvements and log support (includes closing https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/29[#29] & https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/25[#25]).
These changes introduce new functionality to _fsserver_, as well as
simplifies some use cases.

.. The first major change is that the server now only needs to use
one socket when using _websockets_ -- address which start with
"ws://" (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/29[#29]). The new default base URL for all _fsserver_
streams and control channels is now:

    ws://127.0.0.1:7083
+
(70 83 are decimal ASCII encoding of `F` and `S`.)
+
This can be changed by editing `FS_SERVER_URL_BASE` in
_include/params.h_; however, we will likely introduce command-line
flag and/or environment variable to set this in the future.
+
This is should be safe to expose on the network (rather than just
the loop-back), but users may wish to use an HTTP(S) as a proxy to
provide some authentication/authorisation.
+
This was enabled by factoring out functionality _spub_ into a
reusable "buffered stream" library, which has been incorporated
into _fsserver_. All the behaviour of streams are now managed
within the _fsserver_ process rather than an external _spub_
instance.

.. The second major change of this patch is the addition of the FS
log to the streams available from the server (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/25[#25]).
(Previously only the "display" was available, which has a reduced
time-stamp format and filters some output.)
+
This is available at

    FS_SERVER_URL_BASE/log
+
that is, by default

    ws://127.0.0.1:7083/log

.. A third change is that the server now continues running after the
FS is terminated. This allows clients to detect the FS termination
and prevents a socket conflict if the FS is terminated and
restarted in quick succession. The only user visible impact will
be a slight delay if the FS is restarted quickly after termination
while the old session is finishing up. This also means, after an
FS upgrade, it's important to either shutdown the server
(`*fsserver stop*`) or restart the system.

.. Fourth, the server can now accept snap commands to be sent to FS,
e.g.:

   fsserver fs snap "terminate"
+
This allows clients to interact with the FS directly through
fsserver rather than needing access to _inject_snap_.
+
No filtering or authorisation is implemented on this command
channel, so it effectively allows complete command execution
privileges in the FS context to anyone with access to the socket.
Note this is also true for _inject_snap_ on a standard system. If
a station wishes to limit local access they can use
iptables/nftables, or use the server in UNIX socket mode and use
file system permissions. Stations that would like to enable remote
access should implement their own authentication/authorisation
that suits their needs, e.g. SSH port forwarding or HTTP proxying.

.. Finally, this patch also upgrades the included messaging library
_nng_ to version _1.3.0_, which brings with it some performance
improvements and bug fixes, the most obvious to FS users caused
some _ssub_ instances in "wait" mode to use a high amount of CPU
time.

. [[cls_chk]] Eliminate `cls_chk` error from `inject_snap -w ...` command when
an error occurs (partly closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/50[#50]). This was caused by
_inject_snap_ not implementing the new linkage that was added for
_fserr_. This is covered in issue https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/50[#50]. To correctly retrieve the
error message would have required making a new interface to
_fserr_ or subsuming it into library routine that both _ddout_
and _inject_snap_ could use. It was not possible to do either in the
available time. Instead _inject_snap_ was modified to output the error
without the message, but pointing out that the message can be
found in the log and display. Thanks to Dave Horsley (Hobart) for
reporting this.

. [[gnplt]] Fix labels in _gnplt_ windows that display the gain curve
coefficients (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/51[#51]). Previously the labels, when displayed
were in reverse order. In one window, there were no coefficient
labels at all. Thanks to Beppe Maccaferri (Medicina) for reporting
this and testing the solution.

. [[holog]] Improve _holog/MASK_. The elevation spacing was corrected for the
example in step (3), using _holog.m_. Axis titles were added to
_plot_mask.m_.

. [[onoff]] Fix _onoff_ for the DBBC3 rack (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/52[#52]). A code block from
_9.12.13_ in _onoff/get_samples.c_ had been omitted, preventing
sampling of the TPI values and causing _onoff_ to crash. Thanks to
Eskil Varenius (Onsala) for reporting that this caused a crash.

. [[cont_cal]] Add support for DBBC3 to `if=cont_cal,...` (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/54[#54]).  Thanks
to Eskil Varenius (Onsala) for reporting that this was missing.

. [[onoff_fivpt]] Update `help` pages for _onoff_ and _fivpt_. Added a section on
switching between continuous and non-continuous cal.  Removed
`if=cont_cal,,` in `calon`/`off`-`nf`/`fp` procedures.  Add
recovery method for misconfigured cal.

. [[day248]] Always check for day 248 problem in _setcl_ (closes https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/56[#56]).
Previously _setcl_ only checked for the day 248 problem (due to
use of 32-bit arithmetic in the time handling code), if the time
model was _not_ `computer`. In principle, when the model is
`computer` there is no need to check for this issue.  However,
since the time is still managed with the same 32-bit arithmetic as
for the non-`computer` models, it is still necessary to check.
Not doing so was an oversight. The result was that there were no
warnings of an impending 248 day time problem if the model was
`computer`.  This is now fixed. Thanks to Richard Blaauw (WSRT),
and subsequently Jon Quick (HartRAO) for reporting this.

. [[monx]] Change the flags for the _monX_ programs in _clpgm.ctl_ from `a`
to `d`.  Since they do not depend on the FS, they can continue
running after the client is closed.

. [[scnch]] Generalize the _scnch_ window to cover Mark 5 recorders (closes
https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs/issues/61[#61]).  The _scnch_ window was initially developed for Mark 6
recorders. The form has now been generalized to cover Mark 5
recorders as wekk

. [[release_model]] Update _misc/release_model.txt_. The release steps were
clarified.

. [[notes]] Improve update notes.

.. The `-q` option was added to
the `pull` to suppress the detached HEAD warning.

.. A sentence was added to the description of the change to using
_git_ that it now even more important to not change the contents
of the _/usr2/fs_ source tree.  Changing the source tree will make
it harder to install bug fixes and updates.

.. The paths to the example control files now include the needed
intermediate directory _fs/_.

.. The sub-steps for updating the control files were corrected
to properly
depend or not depend on the old version being _9.12.12_.

.. A sub-step was added to make using the FS display server the default.

.. A sub-step was added for updating the _~/.Xresources_ file for _oper_
and _prog_.

.. A sub-step to update where the `TMOUT` environment variable is unset
for stations using FSL10 was added.

.. A recommendation was added to sign-up for the _go_ language
announcements to be informed of security updates if you are
installing the latest version of _go_ lnaguage.

. [[case]] Input is now case sensitive. As was the case for the VGOS branch,
operator, schedule, and procedure is now case sensitive. This change
should present no difficulties if all normal input is in lower case.
All SNAP commands and most parameters are lower case.
+

The change was made because in some cases it necessary to send upper
or mixed case input to devices and other computers from SNAP commands.
For MAT and GPIB communication, all communications sent to the devices
is still mapped to upper case.
+

The biggest consequence of this change is perhaps that strings sent in
`antenna=...` commands to the antenna are not by default be mapped to
upper case. If this an issue for a particular antenna, it may require
changes to your _antcn_ program. This is covered in the
<<Case sensitive strings in antenna= commands>> sub-step of the
<<Update station programs>> step above.

. [[tpicdno]] `tpicd=no` requires a running (not halted) schedule to log data.
This changes was introduced from VGOS branch, where it critical to
avoid logging very large amounts of data for RDBE systems if the
schedule ends or is halted while _tpicd_ is recording data. It is
probably beneficial for all back-ends, so has been made a general
feature.

=== Details of drudg changes

This sub-section is divided into three parts. Please see
<<Changes from FS9>> above for an explanation of the parts.

==== Changes that are in common since FS9

. [[bit3264_drudg]] Source code now works on 32- and 64-bit platforms.
The use of FORTRAN requires eight-byte integers to support some calls
in the VEX library. As a result the _drudg_ program has its own
version of the _lnfch_ library, _skdrlnfch_, which uses eight byte
integers, as does the _skdrutil_, as well as _drudg_ itself. The rest
of the FS uses four byte integers by default.

. [[git_drudg]] Source version control is maintained with _git_. The
_drudg_ program is external to the FS. For each _drudg_ update the
source in imported into the FS _git_ repo for distribution with the
FS. This does not provide the same level of tracking as having _drudg_
itself in _git_ but it is still useful.

. [[uninit]] Fix uninitialized variables. Several previously uninitialized variables are
    now initialized. As part of this `implicit none` was added to all FORTRAN
    routines that did not have it before, except for _xat.f_.

. [[preob]] Fix missing `preob` when `EARLY` start non-zero. This was broken
    in the implementation of staggered start for FS _9.13.0_ and has been
    restored.

. [[wait]] Add support for additional wait at the end of recording for
    broadband. This allows schedules to include a fixed amount of
    additional wait for buffering per station. This seems to be needed
    for Mark 6 recorders in configurations that otherwise would
    require no buffer time for disks that are slower than nominal.

. [[comment]] Update comment on line three of _.snp_ files. Previously at the
    end of line, the number of passes and the tape length were
    listed. Since there is no tape support, these fields were replaced
    with the recorder type.
