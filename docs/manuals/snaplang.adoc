1.0 INTRODUCTION

The Mark Ill Field System uses the SNAP (Standard Notation for Astronomy
erocedures) language for experiment control. The language was proposed
originally in early 1979; during 1979 the initial implementation of some
of the features of SNAP was accomplished. Since that time, more of the
specifications have been implemented in later versions of the Mark Ill
Field System. As of version 3.1, all of SNAP was implemented except for
the "wait for completion" feature and logical branching.

The scope of intended use for SNAP has been reduced trom its original
conception. Since it appears that primarily VLBI experiments will be
controlled via SNAP, certain changes have been made in the
specifications. This Manual contains a description of SNAP as it is
currently implemented specifically for Mark Ill VLBI experiment control.
In the flow of VLBI data, the Field System of programs fit between the
scheduling system and the delogging and correlator system.

Refer to the companion SNAP Command manual for detailed descriptions of
the implemented commands. Refer to the Standard Procedures manual for
lists of procedures that are commonly used.
____

SNAP-I

==== 2.0 GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF SNAP

____
SNAP has the following general attributes:
____

* Time-sequencing is an integral part of SNAP. Commands are executed one
after another. The language provides the ability to suspend execution of
a stream of commands until a certain time has passed or an event has
occurred.
* Logging is automatic for all commands, responses, and errors for full
accountability after the experiment. Display on the operator's console
of all high-level commands for on-line monitoring is automatic, with
optional expanded display for detailed monitoring.
* The syntax and protocol for SNAP are simple for operators to learn and
use quickly. Only a few basic "rules" of protocol need be learned prior
to using any command.
* Often-used sequences of commands may be defined as procedures and then
invoked as a single higher-level command. Procedures may be nested
within procedures.

==== 3.0 SNAP DEFINITIONS

____
fun.G.ti.QQ- a SNAP word which has an action and/or a parameter value or
set of parameter values associated with it. Functions are "built in" to
SNAP and cannot be modified in the field.

command - a contiguous set of non-blank characters requesting an action
(or actions). Each SNAP command is both delimited and terminated by
either a space(s) or carriage return. A single command may set, query,
or log functions and parameters; invoke a procedure; or control the time
flow of events.

+++procedure+++ - a defined sequence of commands that may be invoked
with the procedure name. Procedures are defined in terms of existing
commands.

+++control commands+++ - those commands which control the flow of the
execution of the command list.

+++schedule file+++ - a disk file containing all of the information
required to control data-taking during an experiment.

+++schedule procedure library+++ - the set of procedures associated with
a single schedule.

+++station procedure library+++ - the set of local station-defined
procedures.

+++vocabulary+++ - the set of all defined words (functions and
procedures) recognized by SNAP. A SNAP word may be up to 12 characters
long, although abbreviations of 3 to 6 characters will typically be
used. The character set A through Z (upper case) and O through 9 may be
used; the first letter of all words is restricted to A through

+++special character+++ - one of a set of reserved characters which have
a special meaning within SNAP and may not be used in procedure or
function names. All of the characters which are non-numeric and
non-alphabetic are reserved special characters.
____

==== 4.0 FUNCTION COMMANDS

____
A function is a SNAP word that may have a parameter value or values
associated with it. All functions are "built in ^n^ commands, i.e. they
cannot be modified by the operator. The value(s) of a function's
parameters may be queried and logged at any time, simply by invoking the
function name as a command. In a log entry, the character ^1^'/" IS used
to indicate a response to a user query for pararneter value(s). In a
command, the character ^n^ = " is used to assign value(s) to
parameter(s) of a function.

4.1 General Syntax

< function >

This command asks for a response giving the current status or value of
the function. In the case of a Mark Ill module, the status and settings
on the module are read back and the response is displayed and logged.

< function > / < parml > , < parm2> ...

This is the general form for all responses to function commands. Each
parameter in the response corresponds to the same parameter in the
command. The response may have additional parameters which are known as
"monitor-only" parameters, i.e. parameters which cannot be specified.

< function > = < parml > , < parm2 >
,image:media/image9.jpg[image,width=13]

This is the general syntax for all function commands which set
parameters. In the case of a Mark Ill module, this command will send the
parameters to the module. These parameters are known as "settable
parameters", i.e. they may be specified and will be used to set up the
module. Each parameter may be integer, floating point, ASCII, * or null.
A null parameter specifies the default value for the parameter, if any.
A parameter specified as * means that the parameter's value is to be
left unchanged.

A number of SNAP functions take the names of Mark Ill modules as
parameters. In these cases, various forms of the module names are
accepted. For instance, VI, VOI, VCI and VCOI all signify video
converter number one, and V 10, VCIO and VA all signify video converter
number ten. The OF distributor may be called either IF or IFD, and a
single channel can be specified as In, IFn or IFDn, where n is either 1
or 2. The formatter can be called either FM or FORM, and the tape
transport either TP or TAPE. NOTE: This flexibility in naming Mark Ill
modules applies +++only+++ when they are being used as function
parameters , and +++n.Qi+++ as function names. Function names must be
entered exactly as listed in the SNAP Command manual.
____

===== +++4.2 Syntax Examples+++

____
As examples of the syntax described in the previous section, the
following commands might be used.

The command vcol

would read back the current parameter values on video converter 1. The
response might look like:

image:media/image10.jpg[image,width=301,height=14]

The command vcol = 123.5

would set the video converter to 123.5 MHz and use default values for
all other settable parameters.

The command vcolimage:media/image11.jpg[image,width=46,height=12]

image:media/image12.jpg[image]image:media/image13.jpg[image]would set
the video converter to 123.5 MHz, use the default value for the
bandwidth, and set the TPI to whatever had been specified in the last
command to this module. The response to both commands would be
____

===== VCOI/ACK

____
Detailed specifications for the settable and monitor-only parameters for
all commands are in the SNAP Command manual.
____

====== 4.3 MAT Module Functions

____
The following syntax is appropriate for those commands which refer to
Mark Ill modules with an MAT interface. A note in the "comments" section
for each command described in the SNAP Command manual indicates whether
these functions are available.
____

[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|< module >
image:media/image14.jpg[image,width=9]image:media/image15.jpg[image,width=9]
image:media/image16.jpg[image]image:media/image17.jpg[image] a|
____
Report the parameters last sent to the module. This command merely
accesses values stored in the computer and has no effect on the module.
____

|< module > = ALARM a|
____
Query the alarm status, reset the alarm, and query again. Response to
each query is ACK or NAK.
____

|< module > = TEST/RESET |Individual module reset function, identical to
the system reset command, but for a single
|===

____
module.

The MAT interface responds with ACK to acknowledge communication. The
response is NAK if the alarm is on. Responses consisting only of "ACKs"
are not displayed unless the command XDISP=ON was issued, and are not
logged unless the command XLOG â€”ON was issued.
____

====== 4.4 Quick vs. Long Functions

____
image:media/image18.jpg[image]image:media/image19.jpg[image]image:media/image20.jpg[image]image:media/image21.jpg[image]image:media/image22.jpg[image]Function
commands fall into one of two types: "quick-response" functions and
"long-execution" functions. "Quick" in this instance means on the order
of seconds; the function VCOI, for example, is a quick-response
function. These functions +++are completed+++ before the next command in
the stream is started. The "long-execution" functions, e.g. the SOURCE
command which instructs the antenna to move to a new source, are those
which take a long (or unknown) amount of time to complete. These
functions ace......i.niti.ate.d.......+++Q.....Jx+++
image:media/image23.jpg[image,width=27,height=12]then the next command
in the stream is started. Functions which are of the long-execution type
are so indicated in the "comments" section of the SNAP Command manual.

NOTE: There are no long-execution commands implemented at the present
time. The SOURCE command, and any other which might be considered as
long-execution commands, is treated as a quick-response command and the
actual time of its completion is not available in SNAP.
____

===== 5.0 CONTROL COMMANDS

====== 5.1 Time Flow Control

____
The time flow and time-sequencing of commands is controlled by the
control command:
____

! < time > (e.g. !123000)

____
The ^N^ !" symbol may be regarded as a general "wait until" symbol.
Execution of the command stream is suspended until the specified t:me
occurs. For example, the series of commands

! 123000

QQ=180

! 130000
____

QQ=90

____
image:media/image24.jpg[image]image:media/image25.jpg[image]image:media/image26.jpg[image]image:media/image27.jpg[image]image:media/image28.jpg[image]image:media/image29.jpg[image]image:media/image30.jpg[image]image:media/image31.jpg[image]image:media/image32.jpg[image]have
the following effect. First, the command stream is blocked until 1230UT.
Then, QQ is to be set to 180 at 1230UT.
image:media/image33.jpg[image,width=110,height=14] stream is again
blocked until 1300UT, after which QQ is set to 90. Commands issued
between ! < time > commands are executed in order of occurrence. Each
command is completed before moving on to the next command, except for
long-execution commands (see previous section).
____

====== 5.2 Timed Waits and Timed Offsets

____
A timed wait may be executed by the command:

! + < time to wait >

For example, upon encountering the command I +5M a wait of 5 minutes
will be completed before the next command in the command stream is
executed.

A timed offset with respect to some reference time is accomplished by
using the symbol to establish a reference time, and then referring to
this reference in a time-offset statement of the form !*+ < time
offset>. For example
____

!12H30M* Wait till 1230UT, then set 1230UT as the current reference

____
image:media/image34.jpg[image,width=12,height=11]+30M Wait until 1300UT

The "current time" may be established as the reference time with simply
! * A reference time remains in effect until it is explicitly updated
with another ! < time > * or ! * command. Time-offsets provide a
convenient way of controlling time-sequencing of actions within a
user-defined procedure.
____

======= 5.3 Time-Scheduling

____
In some applications it is desired that certain actions be initiated at
a specified time or at intervals regardless of the antenna pointing
schedule, such as logging weather or certain system parameters. Actions
of this type which do not interfere with other events in a command
stream may bÃ© time-scheduled as follows:

< function or procedure > @ < start time > , < period > , < stop time >
where

< function or procedure > Any SNAP function or procedure.

< start time > UT time at which the command should first be executed. If
< start time > is not specified, all current time-scheduling for this
command is cancelled. < start time > may be specified as ! meaning
"now", or as ! +wait to wait a specified time before starting.

< period > How often to repeat the command. If < period > is not
specified, the command is executed only once.

< stop time > The last time to execute the command. If < stop time > is
not specified, the command will be repeated indefinitely until
cancelled. < stop time > may also be in the form I +wait to stop after a
specified time has passed.

All of the fields < start time > , < period>, and < stop time > use the
SNAP time format (section 10.0). It is legal to time-schedule a command
more than once; each time-scheduling will be handled independently.

As an example of a time scheduled command,

image:media/image35.jpg[image,width=42,height=12]140000

would schedule weather info to be logged every 15 minutes starting
immediately and ending at 1400UT. Command execution would then proceed
immediately to the next command in the command stream after doing the WX
command for the first time.

To cancel the above example WX monitor before 14H UT occurs, use the
command

Commands which are time-scheduled are inserted into the main line
command stream at the specified time. Inadvertent nesting of procedures
is not permitted in this operation, however. Thus, procedures which are
timescheduled may be subject to delay in execution until the
currently-executing procedure, if any, is completed. There is no
provision for asynchronous execu-

tion of more than the two main command streams. It is recommended that
use of this feature be restricted to repetitive scheduling of
non-interfering functions or procedures such as weather monitoring.
____

====== 5.4 Cancellation of Time-Scheduled Commands

____
There are a number of situations in which time-scheduled commands are
cancelled. One, mentioned above, is when an ex licit command to do so
(e.g. WX@) is issued. In this case all occurrences of t e specified
command on the time-schedule list are cancelled.

When an error occurs during execution of a time-scheduled function or
procedure, the particular entry on the time-schedule list which is
involved is cancelled from the list.

image:media/image36.jpg[image]image:media/image37.jpg[image]image:media/image38.jpg[image]image:media/image39.jpg[image]image:media/image40.jpg[image]When
a new schedule is started with the SCHEDULE =xx command, anything on the
time list related to a previous schedule is cancelled. This includes
time scheduled procedures from the old schedule procedure library as
well as procedures, functions and timed-waits initiated by the schedule.

When the operator command stream is flushed with the FLUSH command, all
procedures, functions and timed-waits initiated by the operator are
cancelled from the time-schedule list.

When a new station procedure library is established with the PROC =xx
command, all time-scheduled procedures from the previous station library
are cancelled.
____

======= 5.5 Waiting For Completion

____
The execution of commands in a command stream may be suspended awaiting
the completion of a long-execution function or a time-scheduled function
or procedure with the command:

image:media/image41.jpg[image,height=11] < function or procedure name >

If the named function or procedure is neither currently executing nor
currently pre-scheduled, this command will have no effect and the
command stream execution will proceed to the next command. NOTE: this
feature is not implemented.
____

===== 6.0 COMMENTS

____
Comments to be logged and displayed are entered with the following
syntax:

"Stay at the Indian Lodge in beautiful Fort Davis, Texas"

All of the characters between quotes are considered to be part of the
comment. A quote character within the comment terminates the comment.
The trailing " is not required.

SNAP-IO
____

===== 7.0 COMMAND STREAMS

____
A "command stream" is a series of commands which come from a given
source. In the current implementation of SNAP, there are two command
streams: the schedule's and the operator's. The operator command stream
holds all commands typed by the operator and commands from within
procedures invoked by the operator, The schedule command stream holds
all commands found in the schedule file, and commands from within
procedures invoked by the schedule.

The schedule stream has priority over the operator stream. This means
that commands from the operator stream will not be executed as long as
there are schedule commands to be done. Once the schedule has come to a
wait or image:media/image42.jpg[image,height=9] halt, the operator
command stream will be treated.

image:media/image43.jpg[image]The operator initiates the schedule
command stream by using the SCHEDULE command. The operator can also
suspend execution of the schedule stream by using the HALT command;
execution of the schedule stream may be resumed by using the CONT
command.

The schedule stream is "blocked" whenever a "wait until" command is
issued and execution of the schedule will continue only when this time
or event occurs. The operator stream is blocked due to execution of
"wait until" commands which occur in procedures invoked by the operator.
The operator may type in commands while the schedule is executing or
while the operator stream is blocked. These commands will be stacked up
as they are typed and executed once the schedule has come to a stopping
place or the operator stream is unblocked.

The operator can force a function command to be executed immediately
without waiting for the schedule to come to a waiting place. See section
9.0 below.
____

8.0 PROCEDURES

____
Procedures are user-defined and consist of a series of any existing SNAP
commands, including ordinary commands, control commands and calls to
other procedures. Procedures are grouped into libraries, up to two of
which are available at any given time for use within the Field System.
Procedures may be defihed, edited* deleted, copied, and listed by using
the Field System program PFMED (Erocedure Eile Manager and EQitor) which
manages procedure libraries. Please refer to the PFMED manual.
____

====== 8.1 Invoking Procedures

____
image:media/image44.jpg[image]

A procedure is invoked simply by its name. For example,
____

====== TESTPROC

____
would invoke the procedure named TESTPROC, which consists of SNAP
commands to be executed in order. Procedures may be nested to 10 levels.

Procedures may be passed a parameter consisting of up to 12 characters.
This single parameter will be substituted for all occurrences of the
character $ in the commands which appear in the procedure. There may be
commas embedded in the character string. For example, the procedure
SKIPF could be passed the parameter 2M IOS by typing:

image:media/image45.jpg[image] SKIPF=2MIOS and this time-like parameter
would be substituted for each $ in the procedure.

Procedures are recorded in the log file the first time they are invoked
after a log file is started. If a procedure is edited with PFMED, the
new version is automatically logged the next time the procedure is
invoked.
____

======= 8.2 Opening Procedure Libraries

____
In the Field System there are available two libraries of procedures.
When a new procedure library is opened, the names of all the procedures
in the library are read into the Field System and these procedures
become available to the operator.

The procedure library named STATION.PRC is known as the "station
library", and it normally contains procedures peculiar to the local
site. When the Field System starts up, the STATION.PRC procedure library
is automatically opened and is kept open as long as the Field System is
running.

A. second procedure library, the "schedule library", is also available.
When a new schedule is opened, the procedure library with the same name
as the schedule (but with the . PRC extension) becomes the schedule
library. The schedule library may be opened or changed independently of
the schedule with the PROC command. When the Field System starts up,
there is no schedule library open.

When the PROC command is issued interactively, the following occurs:
____

* cancel all time-scheduled procedures and events related to the
schedule procedure library and flush stacks
image:media/image46.jpg[image] close old library
image:media/image47.jpg[image] open new library and read in all
procedure names

____
If the procedure library named in the command does not exist, you are
left without a schedule procedure library open to the Field System.

When the SCHEDULE command is issued, the following happens:
____

* cancel all time-scheduled procedures and timed waits related to the
previous schedule and flush stacks image:media/image48.jpg[image] close
previous schedule and schedule procedure library
image:media/image49.jpg[image] open new schedule and procedure library
and read in all procedure names
* find place in the schedule

____
image:media/image50.jpg[image]image:media/image51.jpg[image]image:media/image52.jpg[image]image:media/image53.jpg[image]image:media/image54.jpg[image]image:media/image55.jpg[image]Even
if the new schedule name is the same as the previous one, the above
steps are done. If the schedule has no procedure library associated with
it, the old schedule procedure library is closed and no new one is
opened.
____

======= 8.3 Priority of Procedures

____
There are at most two libraries of procedures available at any one time:
the station library STATION.PRC and the schedule library, which may be
station or schedule-specific. A procedure from the schedule library has
precedence over any same-named procedure in the station library, i.e.
the station procedure can never be accessed. Also, a SNAP function has
precedence over any same-named procedure in either library, i.e. the
procedure could never be accessed.

The list of SNAP function names is checked first, so any procedure with
the same name as a "built-in" command could never be accessed.
____

======= 8.4 Field System Procedure Handling

____
When a schedule-invoked procedure is executing and a timed wait is
encountered within the procedure, the schedule stream is blocked until
the specified time, allowing the operator stream to be processed. Since
the operator may invoke a procedure, it is therefore possible to have
two procedures "executing" at the same time, one from each command
stream.

Therefore, to avoid confusion, there is an independent control structure
for each command stream to handle procedures.
____

The central component of the control structure is a stack which contains

____
procedure identification and place-marking information for the current
executing procedure and its calling procedure, If any, and so on up to a
maximum nesting of 10 levels. While nesting is allowed, recursion,
either direct or indirect, is not. That is, the same procedure may not
occur twice on the same stack.

image:media/image56.jpg[image]As long as a procedure is in the midst of
execution, no other commands from the corresponding command stream will
be executed, even during timed waits, with the exception of immediate
execution operator commands (see section 9.0) and time-scheduled events
which are not procedure calls. Note that a time-scheduled procedure call
will not be processed until the corresponding procedure stack is empty.
Thus, it is possible that the time-scheduled procedure may not execute
when it is expected.
____

======= 8.5 Modifying Procedures

____
Procedures may be modified at any time using the program PFMED. The new
version of the procedure will not become available until the stack of
procedures is empty of all references to the library in which the
modified procedure resides. This restriction is related to the
implementation of procedures as subcomponents of a single disk file.

Editing procedures must be done using PFMED. Although procedure
libraries are ASCII files, no other method of editing is supported, and
any other method is actively discouraged.
____

==== 9.0 IMMEDIATE EXECUTION OPERATOR COMMANDS

____
image:media/image57.jpg[image]image:media/image58.jpg[image]There is an
exception to the priority ordering of the schedule and operator command
streams: the "immediate execution" operator commands. There is a set of
commands which, when invoked by the operator, will be executed
immediately after the currently-executing command is finished. This
enables the operator to have some control over the schedule and to halt
it (if necessary), turn on or off logging or display, interrupt a
procedure, etc. Commands such as HALT, ECHO, BREAK, and XDISP are
included in this set of commands.

Time-scheduled functions are also handled immediately. In order to make
+++any+++ +++function+++ execute immediately, time-schedule it for
"now". For example, to get the antenna pointing status logged as soon as
the antenna comes on source, even though the schedule set-up is
executing, you could use the command ONSOURCE@!. It is not possible to
schedule procedures for immediate execution since they involve many
commands.
____

==== 10.0 FORMATS FOR TIME AND ANGLES

____
Several commands allow times to be specified. Currently, in all time
formats, the following limits are checked:
____

[width="100%",cols="31%,45%,24%",options="header",]
|===
|<ays |between a|
____
1 and 366
____

|hours |between |O and 23
a|
____
minutes
____

|between |O and 59
|seconds a|
____
between
____

|O and 59
|===

____
This means, for example, that a time of 90 seconds must be specified as
1 M30S.

The default format for < time > is fully numeric:

yydddhhmmss.sss or yymmddhhmmss.sss

The year, month, and date may be truncated from the left, but hours,
minutes, and seconds must always be specified, i.e. this format has at
least six digits and leading zeros must be supplied. Each field of <
time > may also be specified with a suffix in the alternative format:
____

image:media/image59.jpg[image]image:media/image60.jpg[image]
yyYdddDhhHmmMssS or yyYmmMddDhhHmmMssS

____
Leading or trailing fields may be omitted, but the fields included must
be in order of decreasing significance from left to right. Only the
right-most field may contain a non-integer value.

Examples of correctly specified time fields:

1 21-1 or 120000 (12 hOUÃŸ)

4.25M or 4M15S or 000415 (4 min, 15 sec)

Angles are used to specify source positions and offsets. The default
format is fully numeric:

hhmmss.ss or sddmmss.ss

for hours or degrees, respectively. This format always requires that at
least six digits be specified. Each field of an angle may also be
specified with a suffix appropriate to the field:

hhHmmMssS or sddDmmMssS

for hours or degrees, respectively. Any of the fields may be integer or
real values. The fields must be in order of decreasing significance from
left to right.
____
