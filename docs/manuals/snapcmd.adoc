==== Settable parameters

* `_chan_` --  `**lo**__X__`, where `_X_` is one of: +
`*1*`, `*2*`, or `*3*` for Mark III/IV/5 and K-4, +
`*a*`, `*b*`, `*c*`, or `*d*` for VLBA/4/5 +
`*1*`, `*2*`, `*3*`, or `*4*` for LBA/4, +
`*a*`, `*b*`, `*c*`, `*d*`, `*2a*`, `*2b*`, `*2c*`, or `*2d*` for DBBC +
`*a0*`, `*a1*`, `*b0*`, `*b1*`, `*c0*`, `*c1*`, `*d0*`, or `*d1*` for RDBE +
`*a*`, `*b*`, `*c*`, `*d*`, `*e*`, `*f*`, `*g*`, or `*h*` for DBBC3 +
`*1*`-`*8*` for all others.  +
No default. No previous value available.

* `_freq_` --  LO frequency for this channel, MHz. No default. No previous value available.
* `_sb_` -- Net sideband for this channel, `*unknown*`, `*usb*` or `*lsb*`.  Default is `*unknown*`.
* `_pol_` -- Polarization for this channel, `*unknown*`, `*rcp*`, or `*lcp*`.  Default is `*unknown*`.
* `_pcspace_` --  Spacing of phase-cal rails for this channel, MHz, `*unknown*`, or `*off*`. Default is `*unknown*`.
* `_pcoff_` -- First phase-cal rail frequency for this IF if not equal to the spacing, MHz. Default `*0.0*`. This offset is specified relative to DC in the IF.

==== Monitor-only parameters

* `rxg` --  literal text, `rxg`, to indicate this line has _.rxg_ file information for the LO _chan_
* `_file_` --  name of the _.rxg_ file that matched the LO value; `*undefined*` if there was no match, in that case the remaining fields are omitted
* `_type_` --  LO type from _.rxg_ file: `*fixed*` or `*range*`
* `_lo1_` -- first LO value from _.rxg_ file, MHz
* `_lo2_` -- second LO value from _.rxg_ file, if present, MHz
* `_year_` -- the year from the date in the _.rxg_ file
* `_month_` -- the month from the date in the _.rxg_ file
* `_day_`  --  the day from the date in the _.rxg_ file
* `_pol1_` --   first polarization from the _.rxg_ file
* `_dpfu1_` -- DPFU of the first polarization in the _.rxg_ file
* `_pol2_` -- second polarization from the _.rxg_ file, if present
* `_dpfu2_` -- DPFU of the second polarization in the _.rxg_ file, if present

==== Comments

This command specifies the characteristics of each IF channel.

It is an information only command in its standard implementation, but
may be implemented as a station command to provide hardware control.

The values should represent the net of effect of all stages of
conversion before the signal enters the VC/BBCs. In other words any
upconverter should be included.  In particular, the values for the
Mark III/IV/5 IF3 channel should include the effect of the internal
IF3 mixer, if it is being used.

The LO frequencies are used by the _pcalr_ and _pcald_ programs to
calculate the frequencies of the phase calibrator tones. _pcalr_ has
not been tested with spacings other than 1 MHz.

The `fivept` and `onoff` commands use the values to look-up the source
flux, antenna gains and Tcal values for the the selected
detectors. The `caltemp` command uses it to look up the T~cal~ values.

For the DBBBC, the second four LOs (`2a`, `2b`, `2c`, `2d`) are not
used for anything but populating the internal LO array.

An `*lo=*` with no parameters clears all LO values.

The monitor form, `*lo*`, shows all defined LO values.

The `lo/rxg,...` line is displayed for each LO as it is set
(commanded) and for each LO in monitor responses. This is intended to
give the operator feedback to verify that the correct version of the
_.rxg_ file is in use. The format of these lines may be adjusted in
future releases based on feedback from users about what is most
useful.

Additionally, when an LO is set, the contents of the _.rxg_ file are
logged, but not displayed, in lines starting with `:rxg_file,`. After
a log is opened, the contents for a given _.rxg_ file are only logged
the first time a matching LO frequency is set.

The `FS_LO_ANTCN_MODE` environment variable can be set to trigger
running antcn in the specified local mode (greater than `99`) to
configure the LO being set. The index of the LO being set (numbering
starting as `0`) is passed as the value of fourth element of the run
parameter array (usually `ip[3]` in C).

In the future, for K4 type 1 rack, the range of LO values should be
`*1*`-`*4*`, for K4 type 2 rack, `*1*`-`*16*`.
