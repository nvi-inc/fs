= DRAFT FS Document Font Conventions
Version 1.1 - July 2021

:sectnums:

== Introduction

This document covers font and other typographic conventions for FS HTML
documents using _asciidoctor_ source.

== Conventions

=== Terminology

* All top-level document sections are referred to as _sections_.

* All sections below the top-level are referred to as _sub-sections_.

* All steps at the top-level of instructions are referred to as
_steps_.

* All steps below the top-level are referred to as _sub-steps_.

NOTE: Steps often occur as sub-sections. If a section, or sub-section,
is a step, or sub-step, it should referred to as a step, or sub-step,
as appropriate.

=== In-line text

The default body font is used for all text, except:

* _italics_ are used for names (filenames, filename extensions,
directory paths, libraries, programs, accounts, UNIX commands,
versions, nodes, domain names, websites, URLs, URIs, email addresses,
etc., but not people, places, FS__x__, or FSL__x__), emphasis,
variable items, and the first use of technical terms.

* `monospace` is used for data (code, program input/output, contents
of files, UNIX command options, FS commands, etc.) and explicit
command/option examples.

* `*monospace bold*`  for explicit input/commands to be entered by the
user.

* `_monospace italic_` (no bold) for replaceable/variable items in
data and explicit commands/text to be entered by the user.

* _<angle brackets>_ around replaceable items that would have been
italics anyway.

=== Code blocks

For code blocks of simple input _or_ output, monospace is used.
Italics is used for replaceable items.

For code blocks with both input and output, the output is shown as it
would for a simple output. Literal user input is bold, with
replaceable user input bold italics.

=== Links

The anchor text in all links is normal body text for simplicity. Using
references to section or lists is preferred to using the numbering or
lettering since those may change. The form used depends on the
reference:

** External URLs -- These are references to web pages outside of the
FS. The anchor text should be the full URL. Shorter anchor text can be
used if explained; this is useful for repetitive forms.

** Other FS documents -- These are references to other FS documents.
The anchor text should be the full title of the document.  The
surrounding text should identify it as a document.

** Sections (or steps that appear as sections) in other FS documents
-- The anchor text should be the full section title. The surrounding
text should identify it as a section or sub-section (or step or
sub-step) and include a link to the document.

** References to other anchors in other FS documents -- The anchor
display text should show content related text. The surrounding text
should identify it as something other than a section/step (perhaps
_change_ if appropriate) and include links to its section/step and
document. There should be a link reference to the anchor at the point
where it occurs, typically followed by a colon. This makes the
location of the anchor visible. The text in the link at anchor and in
the reference(s) should be the same.

** References to sections/steps of the current document -- The anchor
text should be the full section/step title. The surrounding text
should identify it as a section or sub-section (or step or sub-step).
Including whether it is _above_ and _below_ is helpful.

** References to other anchors in the current document -- The anchor
text should show content related text. The surrounding text should
identify it as something other than a section/step (perhaps _change_
if appropriate) and include a link to its section/step.  There should
be a link reference to the anchor at the point where it occurs,
typically followed by a colon. This makes the location of the anchor
visible. The text in the link at anchor and in the reference(s) should
be the same.

** An appendix is referred to as an "`appendix`" but is otherwise
referenced the same as a section. Sections, steps, sub-sections, and
sub-steps in appendices are referenced the same as ones in the main
document.

=== Document titles

Document titles use normal important word capitalization.  Upper case
is used for acronyms and technical terms that are normally upper case.
There are no special fonts in document titles.

=== Section and sub-section titles

The first word and proper names in sections and sub-section titles
start with capital letters. Upper case is used for acronyms and
technical terms that are normally upper case. Other words are all
lower case.

There are no special fonts in section and sub-section titles for
simplicity. Such formatting may also trigger different results for
different _asciidoctor_ versions.

=== General guidelines for admonitions

These are not firm distinctions.

TIP: Advice

NOTE: Non-essential, supplemental,  information

CAUTION: Could cause a minor issue

WARNING: Could cause a major issue

IMPORTANT: Will result in a major issue

== Source examples

=== Italics 

  Use single underscores around _words_ to be in italics; double underscores for __char__acters.

Results in:

Use single underscores around _words_ to be in italics; double underscores for __char__acters.

=== Monospace

  Use single backticks around `words` to be in monospace; double backticks for ``char``acters.

Results in:

Use single backticks around `words` to be in monospace; double backticks for ``char``acters.

=== Monospace bold

  Use single backticks and asterisks around `*words*` to be in monospace bold; double backticks and single asterisks for ``*char*``acters.

Results in:

Use single backticks and asterisks around `*words*` to be in monospace bold; double backticks and single asterisks for ``*char*``acters.

=== Monospace italic
 
  Use single backticks and underscores around `_words_` to be in monospace italics; double backticks and single underscores for ``_char_``acters.

Results in:

Use single backticks and underscores around `_words_` to be in
monospace italics; double backticks and single underscores for
``_char_``acters.

=== Curved quotes

 Add backticks inside '`quotes`' to make them "`curved.`"

Results in:

Add backticks inside '`quotes`' to make them "`curved.`"

=== Code blocks

Code blocks are created by indenting text, or preceding and following
it with four periods.

=== Italics and bold in code blocks

    [subs="+quotes"]
    ....
    login: _account_
    password: _password_
    $ *ls* *_dir_*
    ....

Results in:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
login: _account_
password: _password_
$ *ls* *_dir_*
....

=== Open blocks

Open blocks can be useful for better indentation in complicated
situations. They essentially make a block that can be indented as
needed. To put text in an open block, insert it between two lines that
each start with two dashes. For example:

....
. A few experimental, __user beware__, utilities were
added.
+

CAUTION: These may not work well for their intended purpose or at all.
They are only intended for developers.  They may change in the future.

+
--
In _misc/_:

* _ntpmon_ -- Simple NTP monitoring

* _time_delay_ -- Simple source acquisition time delay listing

* _tpcont_rdbe_ -- Simple RDBE continuous TP extraction
--
+

In _chk_time_/:

*  _chk_time_ a simple utility for checking for NTP time jumps.
....

=== Admonitions

Admonitions are created by starting a line with the admonition in
capital letters followed by a colon and space.

For admonitions with complex content, a _block_ can be made by putting
the capitalized admonition in square brackets, then on the next line
four equal signs, then ending the block with a line of four equal
signs.

=== Linking to inline anchors

Inline anchors provide a way to link to arbitrary text. To assist the
reader, the location of the inline anchor can made visible by
including a link to it where it occurs. By convention, this
"`visibility`" link is usually followed by semicolon. To ease
identifying the anchor, all links to the inline anchor, including the
visibility link, should use the same anchor text. An example of using
an inline anchor:

....
[[check_files]]<<check_files,Check files>>:

Some explanatory text probably follows. The inline anchor above is in
double square brackets `+++[[<i>anchor</i>]]+++`. The link with
anchor text, is in double angle brackets
`+++<<<i>anchor</i>,<i>text</i>>>+++`.

Somewhere else in the document, before or after the inline anchor,
include a link to it. In this example, see <<check_files,Check
files>>, above.

It can also be referred to from a different document with something of
the form <<font_conventions.adoc#check_files,Check files>> with the
correct relative path to the document. Including a link to the section
and the document will be helpful for those working from a print-out.
....

Renders as:

[[check_files]]<<check_files,Check files>>:

Some explanatory text probably follows. The inline anchor above is in
double square brackets `+++[[<i>anchor</i>]]+++`. The reference, with
anchor text, is in double angle brackets
`+++<<<i>anchor</i>,<i>text</i>>>+++`.

Somewhere else in the document, before or after the inline anchor,
include a reference to it. In this example, see <<check_files,Check
files>>, above.

It can also be referred to from a different document with something of
the form <<font_conventions.adoc#check_files,Check files>> with the
correct relative path to the document. Including a reference to the
section and the document will be helpful for those working from a
print-out.

=== Appendices

Add appendices by inserting `:doctype: book` before the title of the
document. Then before the _each_ appendix insert `[appendix]`. The
appendix title appears as a document title (conceptually it is a new
book). Sections start with `===` (conceptually they are sub-sections).
Sub-sections (`====`) can be added as needed:

....
:doctype: book

= Document title

[appendix]

= Title of appendix

=== Title of section

==== Title of sub-section

....

== Workarounds

This section covers some ad hoc workarounds for issues with _asciidoctor_.
:
=== Effect of references to sections in other documents on italics

In some cases a reference to a section header in a different document, e.g.,:

  <<beta2.adoc#_update_control_files,Update control files>>

may fail to link properly if there are italicized words (implemented
as single underscores on each side of the word) later in the same
paragraph.

There are two possible fixes. The first is preferred.

. Change the single underscores around all the following words to be
italicized in the same paragraph to be double underscores.
+

This treats them as _characters_ to be italicized, which is
syntactically correct, if somewhat typographically redundant. This is
the preferred approach since it stays within the normal syntax.

. Change the `\#\_` in the reference to `#\_`.
+

While more compact typographically, this is not preferred because it
is outside the normal syntax. And although it fixes the link, single
underscores for italics will then not work for words that follow in
that paragraph.
