= FS Environment Variables
Version 1.6 - October 2022

:sectnums:

== Introduction

This document describes user settable Linux environment variables used
by the FS and how to set them. There are two categories of variables:
_make_ time and runtime.

// Some environment variables used internally are also listed.

== Setting environment variables

=== With bash

If you are using _bash_, you can set environment variables with the
_export_ command. For example, to set the value of a hypothetical
environment variable `VAR` to `1`, use:

  export VAR=1

If _bash_ is your login shell, you can have the variable set
automatically for your sessions when you login by adding the command
to your _~/.proflle_ file. For a change in that file to come into
effect, it is necessary to logout and log back in again.

=== With tcsh

If you are using _tcsh_, you can set environment variables with the
`setenv` command. For example, to  set the value of a hypothetical
environment variable `VAR` to `1`, use:

  setenv VAR 1

If _tcsh_ is your login shell, you can have the variable set
automatically for your sessions when you login by adding the command
to your _~/.login_ file. For a change in that file to come into
effect, it is necessary to logout and log back in again.

== Make time variables

These variables, if used, are usually set for the _prog_ account since
it is used to build the FS. For _prog_ users with _bash_ as their
login shell, they are usually set in _~/.profile_ using the _export_
command; with _tcsh_, in _~/.login_, using _setenv_. See the
<<Setting environment variables>> section above for more information.

=== FS_DISPLAY_SERVER_NO_MAKE

Nominal value is `1`.

If set, this variable suppresses building the display server into the
FS. This may be useful to allow building the FS usable on systems that
can't support the display server.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FS_SERIAL_CLOCAL

Nominal value is `1`.

If set, this variable causes the opening of serial ports to be
preceded by:

. An `open()` with `O_NONBLOCK`
. Setting the port to `CLOCAL`
. Closing it

This works-around a problem that causes the normal `open()` to block.
Apparently starting with FSL9 (_Wheezy_), the system boots with the
ports initially as `-CLOCAL`.

This was introduced in _9.11.6_, August, 2014.

=== FS_TINFO_LIB

Nominal value is `1`.

If set, this variable causes the _tinfo_ library to be explicitly
searched when building programs that use _ncurses_.  This should only
be needed/used if the _ncurses_ library on the systems does not
include the _tinfo_ library. This issue was reported by Mamoru Sekido
(Kashima).

This was introduced in _9.13.0_, September, 2018.

=== NO_FTOK_FS

Nominal value is `TRUE`.

If set, removes use of _ftok()_ in setting _System V_ IPC key valuess.
This is needed for some old OSs that do not have the function. Using
this variable will increase the likelihood of a conflict with other
_System V_ IPC key values, which may cause some very difficult to
diagnose problems.

This was introduced in _9.7.0_, July, 2004.

== Runtime variables

These variables, if used, are usually set for the _oper_ and _prog_
accounts since they are used to run the FS. For users with _bash_ as
their login shell, they are usually set in _~/.profile_ using the
_export_ command; with _tcsh_, in _~/.login_, using _setenv_. See the
<<Setting environment variables>> section above for more information.

After changing the value of any runtime environment variable that
starts with `FS_` (or the `HOME`, `S2_PING`, `STATION`, `TERM`
variables), it is necessary to restart the FS for the new value to
become effective.

[NOTE]
====

If you are using the display server and you are using an FS version up
to and including _10.1.0_ (or more precisely, a commit up to and
including `3abb6b04ee12ccbaef55bc58ef13c356d8398c6f`), to set or
change the value of an environment variable, it is necessary, after
terminating the FS, to either reboot, or to stop _fsserver_, with:

  fsserver stop

Then set the environment variable and restart the FS.

====

=== DATA_CENTERS

Nominal value is a, space separated, list, of data centers. Supported
data centers are `BKG`, `CDDIS`, `HAYSTACK` (VGOS only), and `OPAR`.

This variable is used by _plog_ to determine the default data centers
to upload files to.

This was introduced in _9.11.18_, January 2016.

=== EDITOR

Possible values are any editor installed the system, this _may_ include:
_emacs_, _ex_, _nano_, _pico_, _vi_, and  _vim_.

Used by _pfmed_ as the editor run by the `ed` command.

This was introduced in _8.9.0_, circa 1995.

=== FESH_BKG_METHOD

Possible values are `ftp-ssl` or `ftp`. If nothing is specifed it
defaults to `ftp-ssl`.

If set, this changes the default access method for _bkg_ in _fesh_
to the specified value.

This was introduced in April 2022.

=== FESH_CDDIS_METHOD

Possible values are `ftp-ssl` or `https`. If nothing is specifed it
defaults to `ftp-ssl`.

If set, this changes the default access method for _cddis_ in _fesh_
to the specified value.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FESH_DATA_CENTER

Possible values are `bkg`, `cddis`, `opar` or `vlbeer`.

If set, this changes the default data center in _fesh_ to the
specified value.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FESH_EMAIL

Nominal value is an email address.

If set, this is used as the password in _fesh_ for the anonymous
FTP-SSL method for _cddis_.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL

Possible values are `on` or `off`

If set, the value is provided as the answer for the _drudg_ prompt for
continuous cal use for geodesy schedules.

IMPORTANT: Note that if it is set and _drudg_ does not prompt for this
value, the _drudg_ output files  will be incorrect and there may be no
clear indication of that.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL_POLARITY

Possible values are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, or `none`.

If set, the value is provided as the answer for the _drudg_ prompt for
the continuous cal polarity for geodesy schedules.

IMPORTANT: Note that if it is set and _drudg_ does not prompt for this
value, the _drudg_ output files  will be incorrect and there may be no
clear indication of that.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FESH_GEO_TPICD

Possible values are non-negative integers.

If set, the value is provided as the answer for the _drudg_ prompt for
the _tpicd_ interval for geodesy schedules.

IMPORTANT: Note that if it is set and _drudg_ does not prompt for this
value, the _drudg_ output files  will be incorrect and there may be no
clear indication of that.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FESH_GEO_USE_SETUP_PROC

Possible values are `yes` or `no`.

If set, the value is provided as the answer for the _drudg_ prompt for
the "`use setup_proc`" for geodesy schedules.

IMPORTANT: Note that if it is set and _drudg_ does not prompt for this
value, the _drudg_ output files  will be incorrect and there may be no
clear indication of that.

This was introduced in _10.1.0_, 2021.

=== FESH_GEO_VDIF_SINGLE_THREAD_PER_FILE

Possible values are `yes` or `no`.

If set, the value is provided as the answer for the _drudg_ prompt for
the "`VDIF single thread per file`" for geodesy schedules.

IMPORTANT: Note that if it is set and _drudg_ does not prompt for this
value, the _drudg_ output files  will be incorrect and there may be no
clear indication of that.

This was introduced in _10.1.0_, 2021.

=== FESH_GEO_VSI_ALIGN

Possible values are `0`, `1`, or `none`.

If set, the value is provided as the answer for the _drudg_ prompt for
using `vsi_align` for geodesy schedules.

IMPORTANT: Note that if it is set and _drudg_ does not prompt for this
value, the _drudg_ output files  will be incorrect and there may be no
clear indication of that.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FS_ANTCN_TERMINATION

Nominal value is `10`.

If set, this variable causes the FS, when terminating, to run _antcn_
in the mode defined by the value set. If not a positive integer, the
value will default to `10`. The intent is to give a way to signal to
the antenna that it should shutdown.

The _antcn_ termination mode (normally 10) must complete execution
promptly.  If it does not, termination of the FS may be delayed, which
can cause difficulties as well as frustration for the operator.  It is
recommended that if execution will take more than a fraction of
second, execution should be passed to another process that persists
after FS termination.  It may be necessary to coordinate with that
other process in the _antcn_ initialization mode to make sure there is
no conflict when the FS is restarted. Thanks to J. Quick (HartRAO) for
suggesting this.

This was introduced in _9.11.7_, February 2015.

=== FS_CHECK_NTP

Nominal value is `1`.

If this variable is set, the _fmset_ and _setcl_ programs will attempt
to check the status of NTP when run, reporting `sync'd`/`sync` or
`not{nbsp} sync'd`/`no_sync`.  This is not enabled by default in case
NTP is not available or for some reason the check is slow. If used and
an error is detected in either _fmset_ or _setcl_ or both, the check
will be disabled for the affected program until the next FS restart.
If the NTP status can't be determined it is shown as `unknown`.

This was introduced in _9.7.1_, September 2004.

=== FS_DISPLAY_SERVER

Nominal value is `on`.

If set, the display server is enabled. It must also be set in sessions
that use the client.

It must not be set if `FS_DISPLAY_SERVER_NO_MAKE` was set when the FS
was _made_.

This was introduced in _9.13.0_, September 2018.

=== FS_ERROR_WAV

Nominal value is a path to a _.wav_ file.

If set, the value is taken as the path to _.wav_ file to play when an
error is reported. This can be used to increase the volume of the
alert used to report an error when it occurs.

This was introduced in _9.10.5_, October 2012.

=== FS_FLAGR_SUPPRESS_ANTCN_ERRORS

Nominal value is `1`.

If this variable is defined, _flagr_ will suppress reporting of errors
from _antcn_. It was introduced when a bug in _flagr_ was corrected so
that it would report these errors. In case that creates problems,
setting the variable can be used to temporarily restore the previous
behavior until the station implementation of _antcn_ can be fixed.

This was introduced in _9.11.6_, August 2014.

=== FS_GNPLT_SIZE

Nominal value is `8`.

If set, this overrides the default _gnplt_ font size of `8`.

This was introduced in _9.13.2_, September 2019.

=== FS_LO_ANTCN_MODE

Nominal value is a local _antcn_ mode, i.e., an integer greater than 99.

If set, the value is taken as the mode to run _antcn_ with to set the
local LO. The index of the LO to be set (numbering starting at `0`) is
passed as the value of fourth element of the run parameter array
(usually `ip[3]` in C).

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FS_LO_CONFIG_ANTCN_MODE

Nominal value is a local _antcn_ mode, i.e., an integer greater than 99.

If set, the value is taken as the mode to run _antcn_ with from the
`lo_config` command (after all `lo=...` commands in an IF setup
procedure), to configure all the LOs in one step rather than one at a
time by `lo=...` commands. The `if_config` is added to the end of IF
setup procedure by _drudg_ if the `lo_config` keyword in `skedf.ctl`
is set to `yes`. It can be added manually to IF set-up procedures
written by hand.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== FS_LOG_SIZE_WARNING

Nominal value is 100.

If set, the value will be used as the allowed size of a log file, in
MB, before a warning is issued when it is opened. In other words,
opening a log file that is already larger than this will generate a
warning.

Any non-negative integer up to 2^63^, noninclusive, is allowed. A
value is `0` will disable the warning entirely. If not set or the
contents of the environment variable do not decode properly, `100` is
used.

This was introduced in April 2021.

=== FS_ONOFF_SUPPRESS_ANTCN_ERRORS

Nominal value is `1`.

If this variable is defined, _onoff_ will suppress reporting of errors
from _antcn_. It was introduced when a bug in _onoff_ was corrected so
that it would report these errors. In case that creates problems,
setting the variable can be used to temporarily restore the previous
behavior until the station implementation of _antcn_ can be fixed.

This was introduced in March 2022.

=== FS_RDBE_MC_DISABLE

Nominal value is `1`.

If set to `1`, this will suppress attempting to receive RDBE multicast
data. This is useful for systems with R2DBEs to eliminate the (not
useful in this case) multicast errors from the log and the display.

This was introduced in January 2022.

=== FS_WAKEUP_WAV

Nominal value is a path to a _.wav_ file.

If set, the value is taken as the path to _.wav_ file to play when an
`wakeup` command is executed. This can be used to increase the volume
of the alert used to "`wake up`" the operator.

This was introduced in _9.10.5_, October 2012.

=== HOME

Used by _predict_ to determine where the _.predict_ directory of
default information is located.

This was introduced in _9.10.5_, October 2012.

=== LIST_DIR

Nominal value is a directory path, typically _/usr2/sched_.

If set, used by _fesh_ to determine where _drudg_ listing files are
placed, overriding use of the same directory as _.skd_ files.

This was introduced in _10.0.0-beta3_, December 2020.

=== NETRC_DIR

Nominal value is a directory path, possibly _/usr2/control_.

Used in _fesh_ and _plog_ to set a different directory then  _~_ for
the _.netrc_ file.

This was introduced in 10.0.0-beta2, July 2020.

=== PLOG_BKG_METHOD

Possible values are `ftp-ssl` or `ftp`. If nothing is specifed it
defaults to `ftp-ssl`.

If set, this changes the default access method for _bkg_ in _plog_
to the specified value.

This was introduced in April 2022.

=== PLOG_COMPRESSED_EXT

Nominal value is `bz2`.

If set to `gz`, it will override the default _bzip2_ compression to _gzip_.

This was introduced about in April 2021.

=== S2_PING

If set, S2 devices will be __ping__ed to verify connectivity before
opening them.

This was introduced in 9.3.204, December 1998.

=== STATION

Nominal value is the lowercase two-letter station code.

Used by _fesh_ and _plog_.

This was introduced in 9.11.18, January 2016.

=== TERM

Used by _predict_ to determine if running in an _xterm_.

Used by (not normally built) _rclco_ to determine if a terminal is in
use.

This was introduced in _9.10.5_, October 2012.

//== Used internally
//
//=== PATH
//
//Used internally by _fsserver_ to insert shims to intercept certain X11 programs when run by the user.
//
//=== FS_SERVER_LOG_FD
//
//Used by _fserver_ to pass the file descriptor to _ddout_ for  writing log entries.
//
//=== FS_CLIENT_PIPE_FD
//
//Used by _fsclient_ to receive commands from _oprin_.
