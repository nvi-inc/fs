2006Jun29 JMGipson. Modified to get rid of old disk2file stuff. Now just processes lines:
             Autoftp on diskf2file_string
             disk2file_Dir disk2fiel

2006Jun22  count_freq_tracks.f  Modified so that if freqrf is
           negative, track is not counted.

2006Jun19  BUGFIX. vmoinp.f vunproll.f ckroll.f
           Changed size of irtrk (or same array, differently named)
           to be (18,32), consistent with iroll_def.

2006Jun13  rdctl.f Removed lmysql_* and ldisk2file* from arg list
           and put in commons.

2006Jan17  BUGFIX.  Modified gnpas to loop over MAX_Chan, not
           nchan(is,ic). Problem with later is that stations
           may only record 8 channels, but this may not be spaced
           sequentially, i.e., 1,2,3,4, 11,12,13,14.

2005Dec08  Modified itras.f to to work with new catalog system.

2005Oct27  BUFIX.  iroll_def.  The routine iroll_def_init had
           irtrk dimensioned wrong.  This holds the passed
           Barrell Roll.  This lead to problems in writing Vex
           files.

2005Oct27  BUGFIX.  Fixed bug in obs_sort.  When calculating time
           for obs, put result in jday(i), not in
           jday(iskrec(i)).  Also modified so that sorting is a
           little clearer.

2005Oct04  Modified frinp to set vcband(1) to bandwidth if not used.
           This is so that  snr calculations etc are correct.
