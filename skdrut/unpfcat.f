C     UNPFR unpacks the lines in the FREQ.CAT catalog
C
      include '../skdrincl/skparm.ftni'

C  History:
C  900117 NRV Created, modeled after UNPFR of old FRCAT program
C  930225 nrv implicit none
C  950522 nrv Remove check for specific letters for valid modes.
C 951019 nrv Observing mode may be 8 characters
C            Change "14" to max_chan
C 951116 nrv Split into two routines, one to read the schedule
C            file line with station names, and the other to read
C            the catalog header line. This one reads the catalog.
