      SUBROUTINE unpfsk(IBUF,ILEN,IERR,lfr,lc,lst,ns)
C
C     UNPFR unpacks the "F" lines in the $CODES section.
C
      include '../skdrincl/skparm.ftni'

C  900117 NRV Created, modeled after UNPFR of old FRCAT program
C  930225 nrv implicit none
C  950522 nrv Remove check for specific letters for valid modes.
C 951019 nrv Observing mode may be 8 characters
C            Change "14" to max_chan
C 951116 nrv Split into two routines, one to read the schedule
C            file line with station names, and the other to read
C            the catalog header line. This one reads the schedule.
C 951213 nrv For backward compatibility, do not blow up if the
C            sub-code and station names are missing!
C 960117 nrv For compatibility with PC-SCHED, do not blow up if
C            the fields after the code are different, just ignore.
C 960405 nrv Remove "lsub" from reading
! 2007May04 JMG  Used to bomb out if stations were numbers
!                Don't check for numeric form. This makes imcompatible with PC sked.
