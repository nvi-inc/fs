Field System VLBI User Environment (fsVUE)

version 1.x:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
fsVUE is a Tcl/Tk program that monitors the Field System. It places emphasis on
errors generated by the FS by making them the color 'RED'. fsVUE also has other
features.

==============================================================================
fsVUE can be executed in 3 diffent ways:

fsvue F  This will give a list of fonts to choose from, and store in into a 
         file named /usr2/fs/fsvue/lib/my_font. You may put any font you want
         in that file manually.

fsvue D  This will give you the default fonts.

fsvue    This will give you the font in /usr2/fs/fsvue/lib/my_font

============================================================================

The following are features included in fsVUE:

[File] - This will allows you to [Load] the stored commands from a file called
       .xfscmds in your home directory, it also has an option [Save] commands
       added by the [Add] command under the button [Execute].

[Displays] - This has a menu of popup displays used by the Field System. 
           General, Time, Tsys, Errors, and Weather.
           
[Execute] - This will display a menu with all the known command names and 
          also allows you to add commands using the [Add] entry. This has
          a window next to it where you type a new keyword and command.

[Log] - If the log name is not station.log, get the right one.

[Examine LOGS] - This will popup a window that will help you examine passed
               logs. Information on how to use it is under the [Help] button.

[Field System HELP] - This will popup a window that will contain the help files
                    from the Field System.

[About fsVUE] - Gives you information on fsVUE.

[Exit] - Get out of fsVUE.

version 2.0:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Same as version 1.x with more capability.But in this version fsvue is a
Server/Client

Here is how FSVUE can be used in normal operations:
1.) It will be started from an xterm window and run in foreground ONLY, 
    much like the old FS.
   
   NOTE: You should not run FSVUE in background.
 
  At the prompt of the login window or an xterm window type: 

   prompt> fsvue <CR>

2.) It monitors operations much like the old FS login window, but in color.

3.) It has the same set of primary buttons for executing a variety of displays.
 
   [i] [File] [Displays] [Execute] [Examine LOGS] [Other Files] 
   [Field System HELP] [Exit]
 
   You should not need help, but if you do the [i] button is where to get 
   help for fsvue.

4.) Use quick start keys such as C-S-1 for monit and other display.
    Place the mouse over the fsvue main log display and click the quick start
    key combination. This is beneficial when you are running fsvue remotely.

5.) It has the ability to service another FSVUE as a Client.

			Using FSVUE remotely:

1.) Same functionality as on your local FS computer.
2.) Start from a remote computer using SSH with the -X switch for window
    tunneling.
 
   prompt> ssh -X FScomputer-IP-or-name -l oper
   prompt> passwd ***** <CR>
   prompt> fsvue <CR>
  
   This will start either a Server or a Client depending on whether there is
   an FS Server running.

3.) There is also a tcl/Tk client written especially for Unix and Windows
    computer that have tcl/Tk.
    This client can connect via an IP address to the local FS computer.
    FTP from your computer:
 
    prompt> ftp your_fs_computer
    prompt> get /usr2/fs/fsvue/lib/fsvue_mon
or
    prompt> scp prog@your_fs_computer:/usr2/fs/fsvue/fsvue_mon
    
    (This will not have the buttons and/or any other features except a 
    list monitor)


                     Using FSVUE with Old FS. 
         ( I would not recommend this. Use one or the other. )

1.) If the old FS is being used, and fsvue is started, two things will happen.
   (1) No monitor information will be displayed on fsvue only on the FS 
   login window. (2) fsvue will have all the button functionally.

2.) fsvue will not work very well remotely since no monitor information can
    be acquired from the old FS.

If you should need help or anything else explained please do not 
hesitate to email or call Ray or Ed.
