version 1.0: First instance of User Interface.
             Many things happened during this period before
             I gave fsvue a version #.

              TNX help file was added.
              Other cosmetics was done.

version 1.18: Change font addition, by starting 'fsvue F', this will save
              the font to whatever you like and store it in a file called
              '/usr2/fs/fsvue/lib/my.font' next time you start fsvue it will
              continue to user that font.
              You can use the default fonts by 'fsvue D', this will use the
              fonts defined by you system.

version 2.0   Version incresed to 2.0 because of a major change in fsvue.
              fsvue is now a server for the Field System. All functions
              preformed by the old FS can now be done with the fsvue GUI.
              Also it has a Client that will start when old FS or fsvue 
              server is running. fsvue can also be started remotely using
              ssh -X logins.
