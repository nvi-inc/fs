fsvue 
version 1.0: First instance of User Interface.
             Many things happened during this period before
             I gave fsvue a version #.

version 1.17: Examine LOGS brings up the current log file when activeated.
              TNX help file was added.
              Other cosmetics was done.
version 1.18: Change font addition, by starting 'fsvue F', this will save
              the font to whatever you like and store it in a file called
              '/usr2/fs/fsvue/lib/my.font' next time you start fsvue it will
              continue to user that font.
              You can use the default fonts by 'fsvue D', this will use the
              fonts defined by you system.
