tacd - TAC Field System daemon.

 This is a daemon; which calls a client 'tacd_srv'. The client contacts the 
server on the TAC PC.

 It is executed at Field System startup, and continues in an infinite loop 
until the Field System terminates.

 'tacd_srv' calls on the TAC host by opening a known IP address, and PORT. This
information is kept in a file named "tacd.ctl" (/usr2/control/tacd.ctl).
 
 When 'tacd_srv' is called by the 'tacd' daemon it stores the infomation 
received from the TAC PC server (status,time, and averages) in the Field 
System Shared Memory "/usr2/fs/include/fscom.h".
 
 It repeats this at whatever the second parameter in the tacd.ctl file
indicates.

 Functions that use this information are:
 /usr2/fs/quikv/tacd.c	/* This function displays and logs, using the function
                           tacd_dis.c. */ 

 There are a few things that can be done with the tacd function.
>
>tacd=time    /* This shows the TAC time. */
>tacd=average /* This shows the TAC average time. */
>tacd=cont    /* This will read the TAC computer more often. */
>tacd=        /* This will stop tacd=cont and return to normal. */
>tacd=stop    /* This will stop the tacd from queueing the FS TAC daemon. */
	      /* To stop it from logging errors */
>tacd=start   /* This undos the stop, and also does a restart. */
>tacd=status  /* This will give the status. */

 example:
>tacd=average	
 will log:
18:23:38;tacd=average
18:23:38/tacd/average,NEW,36647.765625,300,0.016172,11.063171,11.093600,11.028600

 If the time is old - it will be labeled OLD:
>tacd=average	
18:24:44;tacd=average
18:24:44/tacd/average,OLD,36647.765625,300,0.016172,11.063171,11.093600,11.028600
