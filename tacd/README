tacd - TAC Field System server.

 This is more like a server that a daemon; it has no forks or such.
 It is executed at Field System startup, and continues in an infinite
loop until the Field System terminates.

 It calls on the TAC host and opens a socket. This information is kept
in a file named "tacd.ctl" in the "/usr2/control" directory.
 After it's initial contact it askes for status,time, and averages and
places them in the Field System Shared Memory "/usr2/fs/include/fscom.h".
It repeats this at whatever has been determined.

 Functions that use this server are:
 /usr2/fs/quikv/tacd.c	/* This function displays and logs, using the function
                           tacd_dis.c. */ 

 There are a few things that can be done with the tacd function.
>
>tacd=time    /* This shows the TAC time. */
>tacd=average /* This shows the TAC average time. */
>tacd=cont    /* This will read the TAC computer more often. */
>tacd=        /* This will stop tacd=cont and return to normal. */
>tacd=stop    /* This will stop the tacd from queueing the FS TAC daemon. */
	      /* To stop it from logging errors */
>tacd=start   /* This undos the stop, and also does a restart. */
>tacd=status  /* This will give the status. */

 example:
>tacd=average	
 will log:
18:23:38;tacd=average
18:23:38/tacd/average,NEW,36647.765625,300,0.016172,11.063171,11.093600,11.028600

 If the time is old - it will be labeled OLD:
>tacd=average	
18:24:44;tacd=average
18:24:44/tacd/average,OLD,36647.765625,300,0.016172,11.063171,11.093600,11.028600
