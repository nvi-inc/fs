# Fesh2: Geodetic VLBI schedule file management and processing

## What is it?

**Fesh2** is a Python package that provides automated schedule file preparation.
It requires an installation of the
[NASA Field System](https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs).

**Fesh2** runs in a terminal window and regularly checks IVS schedule
repositories for new or updated versions of Master files and schedule files for
one or more specified stations. A check for the latest version of the Master
file(s) is done first, but skipped if the time since the last check is less than
a specified amount.
Similarly, checks on schedule files are only done if the time since the last
check exceeds a specified time. If new or updated schedules are found, they are
optionally processed with **Drudg**
to produce `snp`, `prc` and `lst` files. By default, once the files have been
checked, **fesh2** will provide a summary and then go into a wait state before
carrying out another check. **Fesh2** can also be run once for a single 
check or
status report and not go into a wait state. **Fesh2** can also be run 
in a `monit` mode that gives a continually updating status report but 
does not process any files. Multiple 
instances can be run
simultaneously. If drudg output (`snp` or `prc
` files) have been modified by the user and a new schedule becomes available
, **fesh2** will download the file but not overwrite Drudg output, but it will
warn the user.

**Fesh2** can be run as a foreground application or as a service in the
background.

## Compatibility

**Fesh2** code is compatible with Python versions 3.5 and above has been 
tested under version 3.7.3

***Note that **fesh2** is not compatible with Python version 2.***

Note that if you're 
using an old version of Debian (Jessie or earlier) then you will need to 
install python 3.5 or higher by hand. This could be done inside a virtual 
environment by a user or on the system as root.

## Installation

**Fesh2** is distributed as part of the
[Field System](https://github.com/nvi-inc/fs) however, it is not installed 
as part of 
the standard procedure and must be done as a separate step as there are some 
dependancies that must be checked first. 

### PycURL dependency

Fesh2 depends on the python CURL
library ([PycURL](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.html))
which should be installed automatically when you install fesh2. However, PycURL
depends on the Python development libraries, and it won't install if they're not
there. On a Debian machine, 

    apt-get install python3-dev

should do the trick. You may also need these: 

    apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev

### Fesh2 installation

Please make sure the above dependencies are satisfied before proceeding.

Assumes that python libraries and executables will be kept in /usr2/fs/python

IF so: 
* PYTHONPATH needs setting up as follows
    `export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr2/fs/python`
* and /usr2/fs/python/bin needs adding to the PATH.
     `export PATH=$PATH:/usr2/fs/python/bin`
  or get `make` to create a symlink from `/usr2/fs/bin`?
* Running `make fesh2` will execute this:
      python setup.py install --home=/usr2/fs/python
* but the installation location could be elsewhere.



Installation should be carried out under the
`prog` account. You may wish to install fesh2 within a python virtual 
environment, but regardless, the installation commands are the same:

Fesh2 is distributed as part of the Field System and can be found in 
   '/usr2/fs/fesh2'. There are two installation options. 
#### Installing from the distributed code:
Run the following:
   ```
   cd /usr2/fs/fesh2
   python3 setup.py install
   ```
#### Installing with pip:
Run the following:
   ```
   cd /usr2/fs/fesh2
   pip3 install -v --upgrade  dist/fesh2-2.3.0.tar.gz
   ```

Watch out for WARNING messages. In some Field System setups it may not be 
possible for the prog account to write to the /usr2/control directior, in 
which case the default configuration file needs copying there manually. A 
warning message is issued if this is the case. 

You will then need to edit the **fesh2** configuration file for your station
(s). More information on configuration is provided below.

A template configuration file is provided in fs/st.default/fesh2.config. 
This should be placed in /usr2/control and edited to suit your site.



## Configuration

**Fesh2** will take its configuration in the following priority order from
lowest to highest:

* Two config files, in this order:
    * `/usr2/control/skedf.ctl`
    * `/usr2/control/fesh2.config`
* Environment variables
* Command-line parameters

Note that Fesh2 will only run Drudg if it DoDrudg is set to True and it is
configured appropriately. See the Drudg notes below.

If you have the configuration files in a different location to `/usr2/control`,
use the command-line options `--ConfigFile` and `--SkedConfigFile` to set them
appropriately.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are recognised by **fesh2**:

* `NETRC_FILE` and `COOKIES_FILE`: the locations of the `.netrc` and
  `.urs_cookies
  ` files, used by CURL for the https protocol. Curl sets these to files in the
  home directory by default. More information is given below on Curl
  configuration.
* `LIST_DIR` : the directory where **drudg** puts `.lst` output files. If this
  is not set, then the `LstDir` parameter in `fesh2.config` is used if set.
  Otherwise **drudg** defaults to the `$schedules` parameter in `skedf.ctl`

A number of environment variables used by **drudg** are also recognised by 
**fesh2**. See the **drudg** section below.  The 
following 
environment variables are _NOT_ recognised by **fesh2**:

* `STATION` is used in the Field System but not recognised by **fesh2** as it is
  possible to configure **fesh2** to manage schedules for multiple stations .
  The `Stations` parameter _must_ be set in `fesh2.config`

### The fesh2 configuration file

On startup, **fesh2** looks for a configuration file called `fesh2.config`. 
*This will need to be set up for your station before running **fesh2** for the
first time.* Use your favourite text editor to modify the file. The comments in
the file describe the parameters but here are a few points to note:

#### Station settings

You will want to edit options in the `[Station]` section to configure which
stations you want to process, what types of Master and schedule files you want
to obtain, how far into the future you want to search for schedule files and how
often you want to look for them.

#### Email

If enabled, notification can be sent via email when:

* a new schedule has been downloaded
* a schedule file has been updated on the server, downloaded and needs manual
  processing

#### Drudg

After finding and downloading a new or updated schedule, **Fesh2** can
optionally run **Drudg** to produce new snp, prc and lst files. The `[Drudg]`
section allows you to configure this behaviour. If you don't want **fesh2** to
automatically process your schedules, this feature con be turned off by
setting `DodDrudg` to `False`.

Because **fesh2** manages schedule files and uses **drudg** to process them, and
to keep things consistent across the Field System, it will use settings
in `skedf.ctl`. However, there are some caveats regarding `skedf.ctl` for the
case where there is not an overriding definition:

* **Fesh2** requires that `$schedules` is defined in `skedf.ctl`. The default
  of '.' (i.e. the directory the software is started in) is too arbitrary and
  could cause **fesh2** to lose track of files.
* If `$snap` or `$proc` are not defined, then they will be set to the same as
  `$schedules`

Drudg may have been configured such that the user is prompted for a response, in
which case it cannot be automated. If this is the case, then Drudg will not be
run on SKD files.

If you want Fesh2 to automatically process SKD files, then some configuration is required. Fesh2 will get it's configuration information as follows, in
this priority order (lowest to highest):

1. Fesh2 will first look in `/usr2/control/skedf.ctl`. Unless parameters are
   changed, Fesh2 will not run Drudg if the following parameters are set as
   shown:
    * `tpicd YES`
    * `vsi_align ASK`
    * `cont_cal ASK`
    * `cont_cal_polarity ASK`

2. Fesh2 will then look for any configuration parameters in the `[Drudg]`
   secoion of `fesh2.config`. These parameters can be different to `skedf.ctl`
   in case you want Drudg to behave differently when Fesh2 is running it for you

3. There are some `FESH` environment variables which can be set and these will
   override skedf.ctl or this file if they are. These environment variables are
   as follows with the lowest supported version of Drudge shown in brackets (text from FS documentation):
    * `FESH_GEO_TPICD` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible values are
      non-negative integers. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the
      drudg prompt for the tpicd interval for geodesy schedules.
    * `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible values
      are `on` or `off`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the
      drudg prompt for continuous cal use for geodesy schedules.
    * `FESH_GEO_CONT_CAL_POLARITY` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible
      values are `0`, `1`, `2`, `3,` or `none`. If set, the value is provided as
      the answer for the drudg prompt for the continuous cal polarity for
      geodesy schedules.
    * `FESH_GEO_VSI_ALIGN` *(10.0.0-beta3, December 2020)* Possible values
      are `0`, `1`, or `none`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for
      the drudg prompt for using vsi_align for geodesy schedules.
    * `FESH_GEO_USE_SETUP_PROC` *(10.1.0, 2021)* Possible values are `yes`
      or `no`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the drudg prompt
      for the *"use setup_proc"* for geodesy schedules, an option to write
      a `.snp` file that skips setup on scans when the mode hasnâ€™t changed.
    * `FESH_GEO_VDIF_SINGLE_THREAD_PER_FILE` *(10.1.0, 2021)* Possible values
      are `yes` or `no`. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the
      drudg prompt for the *"VDIF single thread per file"* for geodesy
      schedules.

4. Lastly, if any Drudg-related command-line parameters are set, they will
   override everything else

*If any Drudg settings recieved by Fesh2 require manual intervention, Drudg will
not be run on the SKD files.*

#### Servers

The `[Servers]` section allows you to list all the IVS schedule file servers you
want to search and the protocols to use for each. Specify the location of the
top directory (i.e. the `vlbi` directory). Protocols known to work are https (
secure HTTP), ftp (anonymous FTP) and ftps (secure (SSL) anonymous FTP).

#### Curl

**Fesh2** uses [curl](http://pycurl.io/docs/latest/index.html) to access files
on the servers. If https is being used
(e.g. to access the CDDIS repository), then **fesh2** needs to know the location
of your `.netrc` and (
optionally) `.urs_cookies` files. Curl puts these in the user's home directory
by default but they can be placed elsewhere if desired. This can be set on the
command line or via the NETRC_FILE and COOKIES_FILE environment variables (
see above
) or in the **fesh2** config file by setting the NetrcFile and CookiesFile
parameters.

## Usage

**Fesh2** can be started by just typing
```
fesh2
```

which starts it in its default mode. **fesh2** can also be run in monitoring 
mode in a terminal window by typing:
```
fesh2 --monit
```
*Note: If you run **fesh2** as multiple instances but with different 
configuration (e.g. running it in the background with SnapDir set on the 
command line, then running it as a monitor with the default SNAP file 
directory) then you may see some unexpected behaviour. In the above 
example, a schedule could be generated by drudg in the non-default SNAP 
directory but ```fesh2 --monit``` would think that the schedule hadn't 
been processed.*

Command-line options exist to change many of the configuration parameters, allow
for a one-off checks
(no wait mode), forcing of file downloads etc. Some common usages are:

* Only consider the current or next experiment
```
fesh2 -n
```
* Just run once then exit, don't go into a wait loop
```
fesh2 --once
```
* Just get a schedule for a specified session, then exit. e.g.:
```
fesh2 --once -g r1456
```
* Force an update to the schedule file when there's a new one available to
  replace the old one. The default behaviour is to give the new file the name
  ```<code>.skd.new``` and prompt the user to take action. The file will also be
  drudged if the DoDrudg option is True
```
fesh2 --update
```
* Obtain schedule files, but don't process them:
```
fesh2 --DoDrudg False
```
* Get a status report. Shows the status of schedule files and when schedule
  servers were last queried.
```
fesh2 --check
```
* Run fesh2 with all terminal output suppressed. Useful when running fesh2 as a
  service.
```
fesh2 --quiet
```
All command-line parameters are as follows:

                        distributions. See the documentation (default = False)
  -y YEAR, --year YEAR  The year of the Master Schedule (default is this year)
  -e, --check           Check the current fesh2 status. Shows the status of
                        schedule files and when schedule servers were last
                        queried.
  --monit               Similar to --check but text output format is intended
                        for a FS monit interface
  -q, --quiet           Runs fesh2 with all terminal output suppressed. Useful
                        when running fesh2 as a service.
```

## Logging

As well as writing information to the screen on activity, **fesh2** also keeps a
log of activity in the Field System log directory (by default) at
`/usr2/log/fesh2.log`. The log file location can be configured in `fesh2.config`

## Running fesh2 as a service

Fesh2 can be run in the background as a `systemd` service. All output is
suppressed and status is available by examining the log file or using the
`--check` or `-e` flag. Here's how to set it up from the superuser account for
Debian Jessie or later:

1. Type the following command to add a `systemd` service:
    ```
   systemctl edit --force --full fesh2.service
   ```
   This should open a text editor. Paste in the following:
    ```
   [Unit]
   Description=Fesh2 Service
   After=network-online.target

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/sudo -H -u oper /usr/local/bin/fesh2 --quiet

   ```
   Save and exit. This will configure `systemd` to start fesh2, running as user
   oper and suppress all output.
2. Enable the service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable fesh2.service
    ```
3. Check the status of the service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status fesh2.service
    ```
4. You can stop, start and query the service:
    ```
    sudo systemctl stop fesh2.service          # Stop running the service 
    sudo systemctl start fesh2.service         # Start running the service 
    sudo systemctl restart fesh2.service       # Restart the service 
    ```
5. To see the current schedule file status (as user oper):
    ```
   fesh2 --check
   ```

If you would prefer to set this up as a user service, some notes are here:

For versions of Debian older thean Jessie (e.g. Wheezy), systemd can be enabled
and some notes are here:
