# Default settings for this station/facility
[Station]
  # station name(s) to process by default. Just a two-letter code for a single

[Email]
  # If Fesh2 finds a problem with a schedule or if a schedule needs manual processing,
  # a notification message can be sent via email. To turn this feature on, set email_notifications to True,
  # specify a recipient(s)  and configure with the address of the SMTP server.

[Drudg]
  # Drudg-related config
  # Run drudg on downloaded schedules? If False then files are downloaded but not processed
  DoDrudg = True
  # Location of the drudg executable
  DrudgBinary = /usr2/fs/bin/drudg
  # Directory for the output SNP file
  # Default is /usr2/sched

  # Directory for the output LST (schedule summary) file
  # Default is /usr2/sched
  LstDir = /usr2/sched
  #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # If DoDrudg is True, then Fesh2 will run Drudg on the SKD files it downloads. It will drudg all new
  # SKD files and all updated SKD files provided they have not been changed locally in the meantime.
  #
  # However, Drudg may have been configured such that the user is prompted for a response, in which
  # case it cannot be automated. If this is the case, then Drudg will not be run on SKD files.
  #
  # If you want Fesh2 to automatically process SKD files, then some configuration of Drudg is required.
  # Fesh2 will get it's configuration information as follows, in this priority order (lowest to highest):
  # config file, env var, command line
  # 1. Fesh2 will first look in /usr2/control/skedf.ctl
  # 2. It will then look for any configuration parameters in this file (just below these comments)
  #    These parameters can be different to skedf.ctl in case you want Drudg to behave differently
  #    when Fesh2 is running Drudg for you
  # 3. There are some FESH environment variables which can be set and these will override skedf.ctl
  #    or this file if they are.
  # 4. Lastly, any Drudg-related command-line parameters are set, they will override everything else
  #
  # If any Drudg settings recieved by Fesh2 require manual intervention, Drudg will not be run on
  # the SKD files.
  #
  # If set, these parameters will override the corresponding settings in skedf.ctl but will be overridden
  # by environment variables and command-line parameters. Uncomment and set them if you wish, otherwise they are
  # ignored:
  #
  #  1. TPI period in centiseconds
  #     0 = don't use the TPI daemon
  #TpiPeriod = 0
  #
  #  2. Continuous cal option. Either "on" or "off". Default is 'off'
  #ContCalAction = off
  #
  #  3. If continuous cal is in use, what is the polarity? Options are 0-3 or "none". Default is none
  #ContCalPolarity = none
  #
  #  4. For PFB DBBCs only, vsi_align setup
  #     Applicable only for PFB DBBCs,
  #     none = never use dbbc=vsi_align=... (default)
  #     0 = always use dbbc=vsi_align=0
  #     1 = always use dbbc=vsi_align=1
  #VsiAlign = none
  #
  #  5. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the drudg prompt for the "use setup_proc" for geodesy
  #     schedules, an option to write a `.snp` file that skips setup on scans when the mode hasnâ€™t changed.
  #     Possible values are `yes` or `no`.
  #SetupProc = yes
  #
  #  6. If set, the value is provided as the answer for the drudg prompt for the *"VDIF single thread per file"*
  #     for geodesy schedules.
  #     Possible values are `yes` or `no`.
  #VdifSingleThreadPerFile = yes
  #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Servers]
  # Schedule file server URLs. Each of these will be checked for the most recent files.
  # Use comma-separated URLs inside square brackets, and specify the top directory (i.e. the 'vlbi' directory).
  # Use protocols https (Curl), ftp (anonymous FTP) or sftp (anonymous secure FTP)
  Servers = [https://cddis.nasa.gov/archive/vlbi, ftp://ivs.bkg.bund.de/pub/vlbi, ftp://ivsopar.obspm.fr/pub/vlbi]
  # Alternative CDDIS (anonymous secure FTP):
  # Servers = ftps://cddis.nasa.gov/archive/vlbi

[Curl]
  # Curl configuration files.
  # A .netrc and a .urs_cookies file are needed by Curl for the https protocol. Curl puts these in the user's
  # home directory by default but they can be placed elsewhere if desired. This can be set
  # on the command line or via the NETRC_FILE and COOKIES_FILE environment variables. The command-line overrides
  # the environment variable which overrides the config file
  NetrcFile = /usr2/control/netrc_fesh2
  # The cookies file is optional and the default is /dev/null
  CookiesFile = /dev/null
  # In some recent Debian distributions, a connection to CDDIS will fail with error 35 (see
  # item 17 in the "CDDIS https Archive Access/File Download FAQ" https://cddis.nasa.gov/About/CDDIS_File_Download_FAQ
  # .html). You will see a WARNING message if this occurs and downloads from CDDIS will not be possible.
  # There is a workaround until the CDDIS server is changed to fix the problem: Set the following
  # parameter to True
  CurlSecLevel1 = False
